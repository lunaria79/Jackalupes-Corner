#### Guy Hudsen
- front page story in 1982 about Guy Hudson and his wife Patricia dying in a car accident. He and his wife, Patricia, had no children.
- Although Guy was a somewhat controversial President, foul play is not suspected. Controversial for **Fancy Flavors**. was an addition to the 5Piece Product line for less than a year in 1979.
#### Ernie Jr. Madsen
- The article that also mentions Ernie is from 1996, when Carl took over as the 5th president of the Roottree Candy Company from "Ernie Jr." Ernie Jr. apparently liked to stay out of the spotlight, and never appeared in the Butler County Times other than a few mentions here and there. **The article does mention an illness as the reason Ernie Jr. was stepping down.**
