# Daily Lives
# Day 1
- Momo and Okarun just move into a starter home in Mt. Komorebi. Both already have established careers. Momo is a Medium and Okarun has an entry level scientist.
- We enter around midday, Momo is unpacking the study room while Ken is preparing for work. Momo stops to do research on her ipad, while Ken goes to work out. While researching, a strange hooded man with a trench coat comes to the door asking for Momo. He wants to know if she's interested in doing "business". As soon as he sees Okarun, he runs off.
- Due to their alternative life schedules, Momo spends most of her days alone. She gets lonely, and it's putting a strain on her and Okarun's relationship. Unfortunately, the two aren't making enough money for this to change. Momo sits eating leftover hotpot in silence. Not even the action movie she put on can help her.
- Momo has a stalker! Whenever Okarun isn't home, a strange man comes up peeks through the windows of the home. Thankfully, Momo wasn't using her magic, but any day now she could be exposed to him, in more ways then one.
