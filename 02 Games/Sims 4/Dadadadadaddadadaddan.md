# Daily Lives
# Day 1
- Momo and Okarun just move into a starter home in Mt. Komorebi. Both already have established careers. Momo is a Medium and Okarun has an entry level scientist.
- We enter around midday, Momo is unpacking the study room while Ken is preparing for work. Momo stops to do research on her ipad, while Ken goes to work out. While researching, a strange hooded man with a trench coat comes to the door asking for Momo. He wants to know if she's interested in doing "business". As soon as he sees Okarun, he runs off.
- Due to their alternative life schedules, Momo spends most of her days alone. She gets lonely, and it's putting a strain on her and Okarun's relationship. Unfortunately, the two aren't making enough money for this to change. Momo sits eating leftover hotpot in silence. Not even the action movie she put on can help her.
-  Whenever Okarun isn't home, a strange man comes up and peeks through the windows. While she and Okarun have reported this to the police, they refuse do to anything. Momo is downplaying the man's behavior, as to not freak Okarun out more than he already is. She starts receiving texts from an unknown number.

**Authors note: why are there so many random man stalking Momo wtf. Trashly, "Tom Peeping", a random vampire...**
- Momo leaves for work, and Okarun comes home shortly after, feeling a bit sick. He takes a quick nap, has a quick snack, and prepares Momo's food for when she gets home. He does not notice the redecorated bedroom until he reads the note Momo left him. She asks for him to move her part of the office upstairs, due to the increased sightings of her stalker.
