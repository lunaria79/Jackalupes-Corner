- Momo and Okarun just move into a starter home in Mt. Komorebi. Both already have established careers. Momo is a Medium and Okarun has an entry level scientist.

While researching, a strange hooded man with a trench coat comes to the door asking for Momo. He wants to know if shes interested in doing "business". As soon as he sees Okarun, he runs off.
