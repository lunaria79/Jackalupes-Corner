Due to their alternative life schedules, [Momo Ayase](../Characters/Momo%20Ayase.md) spends most of her days alone. She gets lonely, and it's putting a strain on her and [Ken Takakura](../Characters/Ken%20Takakura.md)'s relationship. Unfortunately, the two aren't making enough money for this to change. [Momo Ayase](../Characters/Momo%20Ayase.md) sits eating leftover hotpot in silence. Not even the action movie she put on can help her.
Whenever [Okarun](../Characters/Ken%20Takakura.md) isn't home, a [strange man](../Characters/Tom%20Peeping.md) comes up and peeks through the windows. While she and [Okarun](../Characters/Ken%20Takakura.md) have reported this to the police, they refuse do to anything. Momo is downplaying the man's behavior, as to not freak [Ken Takakura](../Characters/Ken%20Takakura.md) out more than he already is. She starts receiving texts from an unknown number.

[Momo](../Characters/Momo%20Ayase.md) leaves for work, and [Okarun](../Characters/Ken%20Takakura.md) comes home shortly after, feeling a bit sick. He takes a quick nap, has a quick snack, and prepares [Momo](../Characters/Momo%20Ayase.md)'s food for when she gets home. He does not notice the redecorated bedroom until he reads the note [Momo](../Characters/Momo%20Ayase.md) left him. She asks for him to move her part of the office upstairs, due to the increased sightings of her stalker.
After re-arranging and cleaning the whole house, [Okarun](../Characters/Ken%20Takakura.md) starts to make a little chatter bot he can talk to Momo through. Somehow, he manages to hit himself in the head.
