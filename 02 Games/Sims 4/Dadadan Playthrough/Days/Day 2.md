Since this is the first time they've managed to have a sit down chat in awhile, they catch up over a game of *Hey Llama Llama*. Well, they catch up until [Momo](../Characters/Momo%20Ayase.md) made the "mistake" of bringing up a local alien sighting. [Okarun](../Characters/Ken%20Takakura.md)'s bosses don't care, so now [Momo](../Characters/Momo%20Ayase.md) get's to hear about the UAE he's seen at work.
