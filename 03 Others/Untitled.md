>>>> The group is getting ready to go to a fancy dinner and an interview with a huge asshole interviewer. The two sisters are working through their anxiety about it, and the men, while also anxious, are pretending everything is fine and rough housing. The manager has had the MC and the LI in a fake PR relationship, which at this point has every member going, "yeah... PR relationship....". It's not official yet or anything lmao.
>>>> While waiting for the limo, the MC starts to get flashbacks, but wants to continue because she doesn't want to let the group down. (They would not have given a single shit, go take a sick day love we support you) So of course, she doesn't tell anyone, but both the LI and OS notice something is off. They both try to cheer her up by horsing around a little (Love Interest) and discussing the flora in the area (Older Sister). It works, and she returns to the present. For now.
>>>> In the limo, the interviewer starts asking her probing rude questions about her past, causing her to start having more flashbacks. The rest of the group intervenes, and the interviewer is kicked out at a stop light.
>>>> During the dinner, the MC spends most of it crying and having flashbacks in the private bathroom. Poor MC.
