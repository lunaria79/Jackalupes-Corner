>>>> Scythia was reassigned to a new bus (Bus #69) which turns out to be the same bus where all the pathetic misplaced nerds go. While never meeting her, all of the nerds are terrified of her An honestly really cute black girl was elected to try and stop her when she got on, but Scythia says "It's kind of you to try and hug me, but we don't know each other well enough for that. " (Our Scythia is kind of dumb.)

>>>> As they arrive at the red carpet and step out, MC feels like her stomach is collapsing in on herself. On a regular day, she would've paid them no mind, but the camera flashes flings her mind back to her past. She feels like she's going to barf. Instinctively, she curls into the LI's side, and his arm raps around her protectively. He leans down and whispers in her ear, asking if she needs to leave. Her back straightens, her mind clears, and she assures him that she can handle this. It's only a matter of time until she crumbles again.

>>>> The older of the two women. Commonly wears black and/or green mermaid style dresses. Most likely Hispanic mixed with Eastern Euorpean. Serious, but quite caring. Loves her little sister dearly, but is struggling to help her with her mental health issues. Probably has some kind of autism. Likes fancy deserts.

>>>> [!note]+ note
>>>> A 5 member A Capella group. Very famous. 3 men, 2 women. I believe that is a modern setting? But the cars and dresses did not match. Like, antebellum dresses, but 1980s cars?  
>>>> Strangers to Lovers. Much angst due to trauma 
>>>> At the end of the dream, there were some fantasy elements that i might abandon. I.E. the MC is a vampire that was forcefully turned *twice*.  
>>>> Possibly A/B/O??? I don't really remember all of the specifics, but I def remember a scene where the two sisters were scenting each other in the car. The older sisters hair was long and soft, a little curly. All three men are very protective, could tie in to pack dynamics?  
>>>> The Main Character and Love Interest, while not together yet, are quite touchy. I remember the Love Interests hands were quite big when they wrapped around the MC's waist when picking her up.  
>>>> The MC was wearing 9 inch heels and *struggling*, but i think that that was because i was inhabiting a portion of her brain, and will remove that from the story
