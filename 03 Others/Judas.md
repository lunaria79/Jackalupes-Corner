>>>> Scythia starts making friends (Cole from St. Joes!) in her classroom, when she was forced into a group project. Cole and the others seemed a bit uppity, but weren't rude so she liked them. She won them over with her hard work and treats she brought from home.
>>>> But for some fucking reason, her classmate Alex inserts himself in the group, demands she give him some of the noodles she had made, and when she didn't have any desert left to give him, broke into her backpack and stole some of her strawberry ice cream. She grabs him by the shirt, almost punches the daylights out of him, takes a deep breath, and then asks calmly (for her) why the hell he was behaving this way.
>>>> Presumably because he thought she had gone soft, Alex proceeds to attack the surrounding disciplinary students that were trying to intervene. Seeing Alex attack her new friends, Scythia sees red and body slams him through a table. At this point the bell rings and Alex escapes into the fray.

>>>> Scythia was reassigned to a new bus (Bus #69) which turns out to be the same bus where all the pathetic misplaced nerds go. While never meeting her, all of the nerds are terrified of her An honestly really cute black girl was elected to try and stop her when she got on, but Scythia says "It's kind of you to try and hug me, but we don't know each other well enough for that. " (Our Scythia is kind of dumb.)

>>>> [!note]+ Scythia (Or something similar to that)
>>>> The scariest person at the behavioral school. But she's really sweet if you try to get to know her. She's absolutely massive, like orc build. 6'5, built like a freight train. Long frizzy auburn hair with chiseled features. Likes baking and reading. Wolf autism. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but she's trying really hard. Doesn't understand why people are mean to her.
>>>
>>>> [!warning]+ the twinkiest twink to ever twink
>>>> You remember that guy you saw at Sheetz? Multiply his twink by four. 6'8, incredibly wiry. Long blond hair, extremely pretty. Awkward as hell. Fashion autism but scared of being called gay. Not because he's homophobic, but the school is. Was terrified of Scythia for 5 seconds and then, upon seeing model potential, instantly fell in love with her. He's *down bad* down bad. It's pathetic really. All he wants is muscle mommy with big hands. Regularly fantasizes about her edging him. What a freak.

>>>> [!warning]+ Cole and the Canaries
>>>> Cole is the leader of the Canaries, the disciplinary club of the school. When one of his teachers assigned Scythia to a group project with him and his friends, he took up the opportunity as a chance to "re-educate" her. However, on spending time with her, he realized that she was quite sweet, and any violence she had caused was severely provoked. He and his friends, while not publicly being friends with her, decide to launch a private investigation behind the scenes on why the school treated her so badly.

>>>> A 5 member A Capella group. Very famous. 3 men, 2 women. I believe that is a modern setting? But the cars and dresses did not match. Like, antebellum dresses, but 1980s cars?  
>>>> Strangers to Lovers. Much angst due to trauma 
>>>> At the end of the dream, there were some fantasy elements that i might abandon. I.E. the MC is a vampire that was forcefully turned *twice*.  
>>>> Possibly A/B/O??? I don't really remember all of the specifics, but I def remember a scene where the two sisters were scenting each other in the car. The older sisters hair was long and soft, a little curly. All three men are very protective, could tie in to pack dynamics?  
>>>> The Main Character and Love Interest, while not together yet, are quite touchy. I remember the Love Interests hands were quite big when they wrapped around the MC's waist when picking her up.  
>>>> The MC was wearing 9 inch heels and *struggling*, but i think that that was because i was inhabiting a portion of her brain, and will remove that from the story
