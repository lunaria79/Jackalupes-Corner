## LICENTIA
#### Secret Anarchist Order/Terrorist Group
- **Krohne Angerona**: The Blood God, Ancient Demon, and the eldest of the Angerona Clan. Krohne is old, but not as old as his adoptive father, Azrael. Krohne had suffered many years of slavery and mistreatment by the hands of ignorant humans. His anger burns strong, and his pain runs deep. Due to his curse, he has a hard time controlling his anger along with his human form.  
  His father has managed to convince him to take a break from his conquest to spend time with their mortal family. Seeing as how he was barely around for his brother Amaris’ life. And Maximas had never met him before. He’s now learning how to balance being a war machine. a big brother and a teacher. Especially since his brothers are unaware of his life mission.
- **Azrael Angerona**: Muerte’s Angel, Archangel of the Death Goddess, and the father of the Angerona Clan. Is largely retired from his more archaeologist ways to focus on his children. However, in the distant past, he was Muerte’s best reaper, and feared across all of the realms. His vast knowledge of war, battle, and human greed is of great help to his son, Krohne, and his anarchist group.  
  While he isn’t helping in overthrowing the fascist anti-hybrid government, he’s raising his younger sons Amaris and Maximas. He views them as the greatest gift that Meurte had ever blessed him with. It’s for the sake of his three hybrid sons and their friends that he fights for a better future. He views Khrone’s pupil Janus as a child of his own.
- **Henrietta Rose**: Henrietta was a librarian in the capital and the informant for the Syndicate. However, the government discovered her mermaid secret after her ex-boyfriend sold her out for money. She was on the run for a while, and is now currently residing in LICENTIA. Krohne built her a living quarters and everything.  
  She’s been close friends with Krohne since he liberated her tribe of mermaids from the hands of the Kingdom of Analin. She’s quite upset that she hasn’t seen sunlight in years, but she’s grateful for Krohne and Azrael’s hospitality. And her younger (?) sibling (??) Janus, another member of the LICENTIA, visits them quite often. She spends most of her days monitoring the government through her backdoors into their surveillance system.
- **Janus Rasmus**: Janus is an enigma. Not much is known about their past, and even his present is filled with holes. However, I am the god of this world so I know everything. They’re a combination of two ancient beings, possibly older than even Azrael. The two beings were forcefully joined together by the Analin’s founders. And after centuries upon centuries of torture, the concious side of these dieties have completely forgotten about their past.The two deities are now dormant inside of the extremely traumatized, anxious teenager named Janus.
Janus was saved by Khrone and Azrael during one of their raids. Janus currently resides in LONEILLI with their husband and son. He is an active participant with the Syndicate, and is Khrone’s star (and only) pupil. He regularly visits Henrietta, who is currently living under Khrone’s house.

## Loneilli
#### The Forest Which the Rasmus’ Reside In
- **Malachi Rasmus**: Goat hybrid and childhood best friends with Maximas. He was a fun loving kind hearted child. But that all changed when his father died, and he was forced to return to his country to rule. At the age of 14. When he came back, he had severe trauma and anger issues. No one really knows what happened to him. He’s trying to pretend like nothing has changed, but everyone clearly knows something is incredibly wrong. Only one person outside of him knows where he got those scars.  
He refuses to see a therapist after the last one diagnosed him as clinically insane and tried to put him in a mental hospital. He proceeded to burn down their home. Azrael is concerned. Krohne is proud. He’s prone to rapid mood swings, and is quick to lash out, so many avoid/tread lightly around him. He’s really only close to the members of the Compound, his partner and his son. 
- **Janus Rasmus**: Janus is an enigma. Not much is known about their past, and even his present is filled with holes. However, I am the god of this world so I know everything.
