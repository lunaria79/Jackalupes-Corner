## Appearance
When *Azrael* was first registering his children in the school system, he made the mistake of saying he was 50 years old over the phone. So as they grew up, he had to change his appearance to match. While his true form looks much younger, he appears around beekeeping age. He's absolutely covered in laugh lines and wrinkles as well as large facial scars. His hands are hard amd calloused. And while his human "race" most closely aligns with those of African descent, he has both albinism and a skin condition, causing him to be pale and scaly. Both traits he passed down to a few of his children. He has kind eyes.
*Azrael* in his reaper form is absolutely beautiful. He has large black wings, that shimmer with stars. *write more*
## History
It is Clear to the naked eye that *Azrael Angerona* is not exactly mortal. While most assume that due to his large wings, the more scientifically inclined would know its impossible for a hybrid to grow that wingspan.
And it's true, *Azrael* is almost as far away from mortal as you can get. *Azrael* has been wandering the **Lower Realm** since its very creation. And even still, he's eons older than that. He is *ᒲ⚍ᒷ∷ℸ ̣ᒷ*'s first and only angel. As well as her husband. For a few thousands years, he worked as a grim reaper, training new recruits to get the ball rolling. But he eventually retired, and wandered the realm as a pseudo-archaeologist. Discovering and mapping ancient lost civilizations for his eyes only.
For a while, he went back to his grim reaper gig due to the **Beyond** being short-staffed. And at his last reaping, he met his first son and beloved compatriot *Krohne*. When he first laid eyes on the man, laying in a pool of everyone's blood but his own, *Azrael*'s first thought was "Damn, this kids needs a dad." And despite *Krohne* being well over the age of 400, he badgered, coddled, and nagged his way into the man's withered heart.
Together, with a few of *Krohne*'s friends, they started **LICENTIA**, an anarchist organization. *Azrael*, for centuries, witnessed the atrocities that the mortals with more committed against those with lesser. And his distaste and anger grew more and more at every reaping of the innocent. And now he's able to finally do something about it.
About 10 years into their operations, *Azrael* was one day gifted with a baby. A baby that turned out to be his and *ᒲ⚍ᒷ∷ℸ ̣ᒷ's*. He took a back seat in the anarchy to raise his children back and the main headquarters. And *Krohne* returned home to help out. Now that his kids are older, everyone is getting prepared to get back in the swing of things.
## Metal Fortitude
He a big boy.
