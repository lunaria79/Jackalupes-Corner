## The Basics
1. Click on a toilet and select “take pregnancy test” after you sim fucked to find out if they are pregnant.
2. Call the Obstetrician to make birth arrangements once your sim becomes pregnant. You can find it under "home" on your sim's phone.
3. Choose a birth option or go for an ultrasound appointment.
4. Many of the labor and pregnancy interactions such as **Swaying, Back Massage** and **Bed Birth** require a **birth partner**. Get a birth partner by clicking on a sim and "**Ask to accompany Childbirth**". 30+ romance or 70+ friendship is required for this interaction.
5. When your sim is In Labor, click on them and choose "Have Baby at Hospital" if you want them to do Natural Delivery or C-Section at the hospital, or "Start Home Birth" if you want them to give birth at home.
7. Sims will get a customizable birth certificate when giving birth through using the child birth mod
### Tips
You can find the **Childbirth Settings** menu by **shift clicking** on your sim. There's lots of useful cheats in there including an option that allows your sim to skip the dilation process and **give birth immediately**.
## Pregnancy Checkups
1. You can share the pregnancy news with a romantic partner (30+ romance) when your sim becomes pregnant. **Do not use the "share big news"** interaction from the base game.
2. The animation has **one happy version** and **two sad versions**. You will only get the sad version if one or both sims have the "hates children" trait (or unwanted pregnancy using RPO).
3. You can then call the obstetrician and go to pregnancy checkups to get an **ultrasound scan**, **blood test**, or **pap smear** when your sim is between the 1st to 3rd trimester.
4. Once at the hospital, press down **"Ctrl" + "Shift" +"C"** at the same time to bring up the cheat console, type in "**Testingcheats true**", press enter, then type in "**bb.enablefreebuild**" and press enter again to edit the lot.
5. Go to build and buy and purchase an ultrasound machine, you can search "ultrasound machine" or "pandasama" to find it.

# Types of Birth
## Hospital Birth
1. You should see sparkles around your sims feet, if you don't see it or if it ever disappears when your sim is in labor, click on your sims and select "Have Baby at Hospital" "Join" again to get it back.
2. You will find Obstetricians located near the front of the hospital.
3. You can ask any obstetricians to give your sim an epidural or check their dilation. Your sim will only give birth when their dilation reaches 10cm, which can take up to two sim days. *Epidural is required for C-section.
4. There is a chance your epidural might fail, if it does, ask the obstetrician to replace it until you have the happy moodlet.
5. There are several ways to speed up your sim's dilation. Such as **exercising** on the **yoga ball**, asking the birth partner for a **back massage**, **swaying** with a birth partner, **going for a walk**, taking a bath or shower or doing the **breathing exercise**. Performing these activities can also help your sim ease their contractions.
6. Alternatively Sims can get **pitocin** to **immediately become fully dilated**. You must use my hospital bed for this interaction which you can find by searching "hospital bed" or "pandasama". Pitocin can also be used to fix stalled labor. However there is **a 2% chance** your sim might get a **uterine rupture,** in which case they will be forced to give birth through emergency c-section.
7. You can trigger uterine rupture through childbirth settings for storytelling purposes. You must use pitocin after clicking "trigger Uterine Rupture" for it to take affect.
8. You can click on a **surgery machine** and "Give Birth" when your sim is fully dilated, the surgery machine will **transform** into a birth bed.
9. Sims will get stretchmarks once they enter the third trimester, stretchmarks will fade completely in 3 sim days, you can **disable stretchmarks** or make it **permanent** in child birth settings. Sims will also get C-section scars after getting a C-section. You can **disable stretch marks in childbirth settings.**
## Home Birth
1. Click on your sim and select "Start Home Birth", you should see sparkles around your sim's feet, if you don't see it or if it ever disappears when your sim is in labor, click on your sims and select "Start Home Birth" again to get it back.
2. You will now be able to "**Call Midwife**" using the phone. Midwives charge 120 Simoleon/hr. Sims who are in the doctor's career can also act as a midwife.
3. There are several ways to speed up your sim's dilation. Such as exercising on the yoga ball, asking the birth partner for a back massage, swaying with a birth partner, going for a walk, taking a bath or shower or doing the breathing exercise. Performing these activities can also help your sim ease their contractions.
4. Purchase a **birth pillow** if you are doing a bed birth(requires a birth partner) or a **birth pool** (requires a midwife) if you are doing a water birth. You may use the "give birth" interaction once your sim is fully dilated.
5. Birth emergencies could happen during home birth, there's a 10% chance this will happen to a sim pregnant with 1 baby, and a 30% to a sim pregnant with multiples, you will see this notification and moodlet to let you know your sim might be experiencing a stalled birth. their dilation will slow down during stalled birth, but there is a chance it will return to normal after an hour.
6. You will get this notification if your sim requires an emergency C-section. ![](../00%20_resources/Instructions_Ultrasound-14.jpg)
7. If you have a midwife, asking them to check on the baby will speed things up, and they will let you know whether or not an emergency C-section is needed.
8. If you do not want to go to the hospital, just click on the **close button** on the top right corner, and things will return to normal, there is no penalty for doing so.
9. Emergency C-section works like a normal C-section, you must get a working epidural before you sim can give birth.
10. Sims can also perform unassisted birth, to do so place down a bassinet of your choice, when your sim is fully dilated you will be able to choose "unassisted Birth". Once you do that your sim will start **giving birth immediately** at where they are standing.
11. You can **disable birth emergencies** in the **childbirth settings menu**.
