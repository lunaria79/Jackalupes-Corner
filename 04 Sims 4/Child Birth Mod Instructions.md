## The Basics
1. Click on a toilet and select “take pregnancy test” after you sim woohooed to find out if they are pregnant.
2. Call the Obstetrician to make birth arrangements once your sim becomes pregnant. You can find it under "home" on your sim's phone.
3. Choose a birth option or go for an ultrasound appointment.
4. Many of the labor and pregnancy interactions such as **Swaying, Back Massage** and **Bed Birth** require a **birth partner**. Get a birth partner by clicking on a sim and "**Ask to accompany Childbirth**". 30+ romance or 70+ friendship is required for this interaction.
5. When your sim is In Labor, click on them and choose "Have Baby at Hospital" if you want them to do Natural Delivery or C-Section at the hospital, or "Start Home Birth" if you want them to give birth at home.
7. Sims will get a customizable birth certificate when giving birth through using the child birth mod
### Tips
You can find the **Childbirth Settings** menu by **shift clicking** on your sim. There's lots of useful cheats in there including an option that allows your sim to skip the dilation process and **give birth immediately**.
