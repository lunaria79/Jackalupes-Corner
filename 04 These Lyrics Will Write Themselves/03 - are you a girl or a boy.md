<p class="text">"I'm sick of all this modeling bullshit."</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi palmed his face tiredly, looking at Joon-ki. It was still early in the morning, but the ILGI members had returned from their PUMA shoot in Ilsan and were just now entering the office for a casual debriefing. They'd come directly to the office, so Yoongi was intending to send them back to the dorms after the meeting, just to shower and rest for a couple of hours before calling them back in again. "Before I address... This," he said, gesturing vaguely in Joon-ki's direction before he regarded the other members with interest, "how did the shoot go?"</p>
<p class="text">"It went very well, Min PD-nim," Seojun said, handing over a CD and a folder. "They gave us A4 prints of the selected shots and soft copies of the raw images." As expected, the leader was well prepared to neatly summarize the events of the past 2 days. Damn, Yoongi had trained him well.</p>
<p class="text">"They've asked that we wait till the 20th before releasing anything to the public, though."</p>
<p class="text">"That's fine," Yoongi said dismissively, glancing at Joon-ki. That one was a spitfire; he was temperamental and worrisome to manage at times. Yoongi didn't want to keep him waiting too long, because he could kind of guess what this was going to be about by the way Joon-ki kept glaring at Cheolmin. He turned to Ki-ha to check up on the kid. "And how was the shoot for you?"</p>
<p class="text">The maknae blinked at Yoongi before clearing his throat. "It went fine, Min PD-nim," he said quietly. "There were no problems."</p>
<p class="text">"Did you enjoy it?" Yoongi asked conversationally, opening the folder he'd been given by Seojun and pulling out the photos. Each was watermarked, but his boys had turned out well. Ki-ha looked particularly good in sporting wear, apparently--- This was something Yoongi had not known. He'd have Jungkook make a note of it for future reference. "You must have impressed them; your shots turned out very well." He should get a couple of these framed and give them to the boys. Maybe they could put them up on a wall in the dorm.</p>
<p class="text">"Yes," Ki-ha said, mildly embarrassed as he averted his eyes. Like PAROXCISM's Ki-moon, he tended to shy away from being the centre of attention, even though Ki-ha looked a little more unapproachable in the first place due to his stature, the sharp look in his eyes and the dark street apparel he preferred to wear. "It took me a while to get accustomed to the camera, as usual, but..."</p>
<p class="text">"He did a great job," Seojun nodded firmly. He regarded the maknae with pride, making Yoongi nod approvingly as he set aside the pictures on the table. It was always good to see Seojun stepping into his role as the leader; it had taken him a long time to grow into his shoes. "The director also mentioned that he'd like to discuss a possible future collaboration, even if it's with Ki-ha alone. Maybe a CF."</p>
<p class="text">"That's good news," Yoongi said agreeably. He refastened the seal on the envelope and let out a long and drawn out sigh before turning to Joon-ki. "So?" He asked, resting his cheek against his palm as he gestured for the members around the table to speak if they felt the need to. "What about modeling is so terrible for you, Joon-ki? Do you want to do music shows and become an idol group like your PAROXCISM dongsaengs instead?"</p>
<p class="text">Joon-ki made a face before glancing at the rest of the ILGI members. Across him, Seojun and Cheolmin were sitting side by side, the latter smiling serenely. Beside him, Ki-ha was quietly looking down at his lap. "They were fawning over Cheolmin again," he complained, glaring at his interlaced fingers on the table. "Which wouldn't have been a problem if they took him seriously--- They kept calling him the visual of ILGI."</p>
<p class="text">"Technically, I am the visual of ILGI," Cheolmin pointed out peacefully, lifting up a hand with wide eyes. "I've heard that my nose bridge is trending on Twitter."</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi lifted an eyebrow. Seriously? His nose bridge? "Could we capitalize on that?" He thought aloud, completely intrigued. The strangest things happened on the internet. "Is it just your nose bridge or your entire face that's trending?"</p>
<p class="text">"It's just my nose, but ENTRIES like my face anyway. I could do one of those product CFs," Cheolmin suggested brightly, leaning in with a beam. "There's this new facial cleanser I use, and it's amazing; I heard from my friend in another group that they're looking for brand ambassadors."</p>
<p class="text">"I use it too," Ki-ha added, lifting a hand. "It's actually quite a good product; there's milk in it---"</p>
<p class="text">"That isn't the only thing you are, right? Are you just our visual?" Joon-ki interrupted, irritated that the conversation had gone off tangent. Yoongi refocused his attention, and Cheolmin leaned back into his chair with a pout. Chastised, Ki-ha chewed on his lip and quietened too. "Can't you rap just as well as any other underground A-lister? Where's your sense of pride? Every time we go out for shoots, they're always saying the same things, and you never correct them. That's why everyone keeps on---"</p>
<p class="text">Seojun stopped his fellow member's rambling with a hand lifted, frowning. Joon-ki was quick-tempered, and his words were usually harsh; it wasn't uncommon for the others to step in for interviews once things were going awry. Even the maknae, Ki-ha, was cautious of Joon-ki's moods, considering a single careless comment could put the group into a lot of trouble. Yoongi was still working on that, really. "I think what he means to say is that Cheolmin still isn't being taken very seriously as a member of ILGI," the leader explained carefully. "It's been years; it's beginning to wear on all of our nerves."</p>
<p class="text">Cheolmin was, arguably, the most stunning artist they had under the label--- He was even more effeminate-looking than Sung-ho, the visual of PAROXCISM, and they were an idol group unlike ILGI. With long hair and delicate features, Cheolmin was commonly dismissed as the talented rapper that he was--- Most people seemed to think he was simply part of the group because of his looks.</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi could understand the struggle on Seojun, Joon-ki and Ki-ha's part; this hadn't been the first time they'd had to witness Cheolmin being severely undermined as a member of ILGI, and it must have agitated them greatly over the years. It sure as hell pissed Yoongi off whenever he was privy to it happening.</p>
<p class="text">Still, there were times Yoongi couldn't help but be grateful Cheolmin had the mental fortitude to pursue his own choices despite the abundant criticism he received. Back when he'd been a hip-hop artist, Yoongi had acquiesced to the makeup and other shit like that, even though he'd never wanted to. The demands of the entertainment industry were varied and of different levels of importance; apparently having a blemish on national television was completely unacceptable. Yoongi could understand that; Bang PD-nim had been selling their unit as an idea--- A brand.</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi had thought he was dedicated back then, but Cheolmin was something else altogether. He chose these things; he preferred these things. Having long, silky hair and skin as fair as literal snow--- Of all their artists, it was Cheolmin who best knew how to apply his own makeup and style himself. He followed fashion blogs obsessively, and had the most extensive wardrobe. He placed a high priority on his aesthetic, and somehow skirted the line of being overtly androgynous with ease and grace, deflecting or shouldering all the hate he'd received for it over the years--- Even pre-debut.</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi would have thought anyone would have caved to public opinion by now, but Cheolmin had proved that for the gentle lilt of his words and the flick of his hair over a finely boned shoulder, he was just as filled with fire as the rest of his members. He hadn't budged at all, and continued with his own style to this day.</p>
<p class="text">Joon-ki was a whole other ball game. On the opposite end of the spectrum, he was about as masculine as artists could come; he gave off the leather jacket bad boy vibe even in a simple white tshirt. He hadn't seemed to be happy with Cheolmin's choices in the past, but he slowly grew to accept them. Joon-ki was the most protective of the more effeminate member now; he was the quickest to react to any criticism thrown Cheolmin's way for his stylistic preferences, and threw the biggest tantrums about the common perception that the guy was nothing more than a pretty face.</p>
<p class="text">Even Ki-ha, who was infamous for putting Cheolmin on a pedestal, couldn't hold a candle to how defensive Joon-ki was of his dongsaeng.</p>
<p class="text">Still, it had been a long time since Yoongi had found it necessary to worry too much about Cheolmin. He asked the question just to appease Joon-ki, though. "Cheolmin," he sighed, "are you unhappy because of all these comments?"</p>
<p class="text">"No," Cheolmin said, calm and genuinely unaffected, tucking a lock of hair behind his ear. Smiling, he adjusted his collar around his neck and crossed his legs. "Antis exist everywhere, Min PD-nim. If reading one comment from them makes me sad, then there are hundreds of other comments from ENTRIES that can encourage me." Shrugging, he leaned back in his seat and toed Ki-ha's boot under the table, winking. "Besides, I have a cute maknae and two strong hyungs to protect me. People will say what they want, but when we win a Daesang, they have to shut up, right?"</p>
<p class="text">For a moment, silence filled the room. Then Ki-ha cleared his throat to speak. "You think we can win a Daesang, hyung?"</p>
<p class="text">"Hang on, you think I'm strong?" Seojun asked incredulously, completely missing the point. "I can't even win some of our dongsaengs in arm wrestling---"</p>
<p class="text">Cheolmin looked straight at Ki-ha before his lips lifted into a beatific grin. "Of course I do," he said airily, ignoring their dear leader. "Don't you trust our ENTRIES? We were nominated for best album at MAMA last year, you know. We'll get there again, and we'll take the win home for Min PD-nim this time." He turned to Joon-ki, who was lifting an eyebrow at him. "When that time comes, I can receive a nice, shiny trophy on a big stage with long hair and lip gloss, and everyone will have to acknowledge us no matter what." His gaze was sharp and greedy. "Wouldn't that be nice, Joon-ki?"</p>
<p class="text">Joon-ki stared at him, frowning.</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi snorted. Nothing had changed, and he didn't need to worry about Cheolmin--- Out of all the ILGI members, it seemed their delicate visual still possessed the strongest mental fortitude. "Yes, everyone and their grandmother knows that Cheolmin is the visual," he lifted an eyebrow. They'd been through this before, numerous times--- It was just a different thing that set Joon-ki off every few months about the same issue. To be fair, Yoongi would be frustrated too, in the kid's position. He might have even reacted the same way in the past, if Hoseok or Namjoon had been similarly bullied.</p>
<p class="text">"He's pretty. We all know he's pretty. His eyelashes are longer than my lifespan, for fuck's sake."</p>
<p class="text">"Thank you," Cheolmin said sweetly, batting his eyes. He smiled at Ki-ha across the table, lashes fluttering. "They're not even extensions, you know. It's just volumizing mascara; you should try it."</p>
<p class="text">Ki-ha shifted uncomfortably in his seat, averting his eyes with a flush on his cheeks.</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi had to hold Joon-ki down to keep the guy from smacking Cheolmin for his nonsense--- The alarming thing was how accustomed he was to retraining the kid in the first place. "But, we also know that he's a good rapper," he continued seamlessly, waiting till Joon-ki calmed down before he released the boy's hand, leaving behind a pale red mark on his wrist. "Hell, he's a great rapper--- His flow and lyricism... I've told you this before, but Cheolmin's style reminds me of Namjoon, back when he went through a full year with strictly conceptual writing in preparation for his mixtape."</p>
<p class="text">All the members nodded. Yoongi remembered that time fondly. It had been the one year Namjoon and he would stay up together night after night, the former poring over literature books and using up 4 pads of sticky notes at a time while Yoongi messed around on his Midi till the birds started crooning in the morning.</p>
<p class="text">"As long as Cheolmin is happy, all we have to do is continue doing what we've always done," Yoongi said, looking around the table. Ki-ha nodded, and Seojun put his arm around Cheolmin, giving his shoulder a tight squeeze. "You don't need to make a fuss about it. ENTRIES recognize your talent, and they'll elevate you if you do your best." He addressed Joon-ki directly, pinning him in place with a stare. "If people aren't going to take him - or any of you - seriously, then that's their fault. You'll just have to make them see it by force."</p>
<p class="text">"What if someone damages his reputation like this?" Joon-ki argued, patting his fist on the table. He was clearly still unsatisfied. "If people start saying things like he's gay, or---"</p>
<p class="text">"First of all, I wasn't aware you'd lose the ability to rap if you're gay," Yoongi said sharply, looking at Joon-ki so blankly that the member's jaw snapped shut with an audible click. "And secondly, if you hear such rumors, your first instinct should be to clarify the truth with your members, not to fight hearsay with assumptions. That's how you make your fans lose trust in you." Turning to look at all of the ILGI members in turn, he continued to speak solemnly. "Make no mistake about it; I built this company on a damn good cause. Kim PD-nim and I believe we're investing our time, money and effort in good artists, who are skilled and hardworking. Based on this principle, I could bring in a rapper from America tomorrow, or a singer from India."</p>
<p class="text">They all listened to him silently. Even Cheolmin had lost his residual playfulness, and was paying complete attention to the words Yoongi was speaking.</p>
<p class="text">It cleared his head. It was at times like this that Yoongi remembered Bang Shi Hyuk PD-nim, and he realized exactly how much impact he had on the lives of these artists signed to his label. He had the option of leading them down the right path, or the wrong one. Even simple, callous words he spoke could hurt and guide and advise them. Just like how Namjoon had stepped up to mentor his kids last night, it was apparently his turn to do the same. Swallowing, Yoongi inhaled deeply and leaned forward in his seat.</p>
<p class="text">"Whether it's sexual orientation, race or religion, neither Joon or I really care," he continued, shrugging easily. "Sure, it'll make things difficult for us, especially in a conservative country like Korea. But shouldn't you trust us a little more by now? Joon and I, we know better than to conform to societal norms like that. We're rappers, for fuck's sake; since when did we abide by the rules?"</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi scoffed, resting his arms on the table. "You auditioned, and you were good enough to get in. Anyone else could do the same," he reminded them, lifting his head. "You're talented and diligent. That's why I chose all 4 of you for ILGI, and that's why you debuted--- No more, no less. There's no reason to forget that now." He glanced at Joon-ki, who was looking down at his lap. "Are we clear?"</p>
<p class="text">"Yes sir," Cheolmin beamed, giving Yoongi a little 2-fingered salute. Seojun chuckled beside him.</p>
<p class="text">Joon-ki nodded, finally subdued, which Yoongi supposed was something, anyway.</p>
<p class="text">Ki-ha let out a sigh of relief, seeing his hyungs happy again, if not at least placated. "Are we doing the re-recording today?" He asked Yoongi, glancing at his leader. "Seojun-hyung said you found some issues with the track..."</p>
<p class="text">"It's pencilled in," Yoongi agreed. "But first things first, get back to the dorm and shower. Rest for a little bit and then come back to the studio by 12; I'll have Jungkook and Jin-hyung pick up lunch for all of us." He was already taking his phone out of his pocket to call his PA. He had another interview at 5 o'clock; they'd have to wrap the recording session up before then. "We've got a lot of work to do again this year, so we better eat well and take care of ourselves. Seojun and Ki-ha have Chinese lessons in the evening, so I hope we'll be able to nail it quickly before then."</p>
<p class="text">Cheolmin shouldered his tote bag with a hum. "Can we have pizza?" He suggested as gently as possible. "The artisan one from the restaurant two streets away?"</p>
<p class="text">"Don't push it, pretty boy," Yoongi snorted, waving them off towards the door dismissively. He lifted an eyebrow at a notification from MINIMIN on Seeking Arrangement, and he waited for the members to leave so he could read the new message. "I knew you didn't care that much about your skin."</p>

<div class="chat">
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">That bad?</div>
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">What happened?</div>
</div>
<p class="text">Jimin looked at his phone and sighed loudly.</p>
<div class="chat">
	<div class="msg sent" data-time="MINIMIN">my landlord refused the extension..</div>
	<div class="msg sent" data-time="MINIMIN">I guess I'll have to go back to busan</div>
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">Your hometown?</div>
	<div class="msg sent" data-time="MINIMIN">yaeh</div>
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">I was born in Daegu.</div>
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">You want to stay in Seoul?</div>
</div>
<p class="text">Of course he wanted to stay in Seoul. Jimin had gotten out of Busan for a reason; he'd always had dreams for the big city. When he'd been accepted to the prestigious S University years back, he'd been ecstatic, and JiHyun had followed in his footsteps to attend an arts school in Incheon. His younger brother was currently on a year-long exchange program in Switzerland, and Jimin was anticipating his safe return. It sucked that he wouldn't be able to put JiHyun up when he got back to Korea so that his younger brother could find a job; they'd always looked out for each other and Jimin felt like a failure, having lost his job and having to crawl back home to share a house with his mother when he was already 29 years old.</p>
<p class="text">It would at least be another month before he got a new job in Seoul, and that was if he was lucky. He couldn't bother TaeTae till then, and he wasn't close enough to Minho and Taemin anymore--- He'd spent so much time working that they'd lost touch, and it honestly made him feel like shit knowing that he probably wouldn't be able to see them before he left.</p>
<p class="text">Still, the thing he was dreading the most was living with his mother again. He loved her, he truly did, and she'd made sure there was food on the table for him and JiHyun even after their father had disappeared from their lives, but... They just didn't have that relationship. They weren't close, and they barely spoke except for the obligatory birthday texts and Chuseok wishes. He'd argued often with her, back when he was in high school, young and ignorant of how much she must have suffered through the divorce. Yet, no one could argue that the biggest casualties of a divorce were children, and he and JiHyun had suffered the separation of their parents in their own ways.</p>
<p class="text">They'd never really sat down to have a proper conversation about the entire affair, and that was probably what had made it harder to bring up after all these years. Jimin had already resigned himself to leaving the matter in the past, but he wondered if his mother had done the same in her heart. Either way, he was too scared to ask, and it would be an elephant in the room for as long as he stayed with her in Busan. It wasn't something he could honestly say he was looking forward to.</p>

</div>
<p class="text">Jimin had spent the most of yesterday evening in a state of disbelief as he walked to the nearby Salvation Army building, dropping off some of the things he couldn't possibly lug back to Busan on his own. Older books he'd never touched, clothes that didn't fit him anymore... He'd somehow managed to pack it all away in a daze, and he occupied his time with silently tidying away all traces of his presence in his own apartment. He'd stopped at midnight, looking at all his stuff in cardboard cubes sealed with tape and sighed, rubbing his eyes and trying not to cry again.</p>
<p class="text">He was so, so tired.</p>
<p class="text">And he was packing again today, still clearing out the pots and pans in his kitchen cabinets and wrapping them in layers of bubble wrap. He still hadn't packed the vast majority of the clothes he actually wanted to keep, and he hadn't a clue what to do with his pillows and bedsheets either. And how was he going to carry the huge stuffed puppy Taehyung had given him for Christmas last year on the bus? It was all a huge mess, and Jimin felt like death with everything on his mind. It didn't help that the conversation he'd had with his boss and the conversations he'd be having with his mother had been playing on repeat in his head since the night before.</p>
<div class="chat">
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">When are you leaving?</div>
</div>
<p class="text">Frowning, Jimin chewed on his lip and sat down on the edge of his bed, deciding to take a short 15 minute break. He should at least give his full attention to someone who was concerned about him.</p>
<div class="chat">
	<div class="msg sent" data-time="MINIMIN">I booked a ticket for tonight, but Im still not done packing...</div>
	<div class="msg sent" data-time="MINIMIN">I have to be out by the first</div>

	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">In this whole..</div>
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">In the sugar baby thing.</div>
</div>
<p class="text">Jaw dropping, Jimin resisted the urge to fling his cellphone out of the window; he didn't have the money to replace it right now. Was MYG being serious? Hadn't they just been joking about this the entire time? Jimin wasn't that desperate...</p>
<p class="text">Or was he? Chewing his lip nervously, Jimin wondered just how far he would be willing to go to stay in Seoul. Would he move in with a stranger - possible serial killer! - and very likely fall into bed with him? Do all that, just to stay in the city? How did these things work? Were there expiry dates?</p>
<p class="text">What were the grounds of dismissal when you were... Employed, as someone's sugar baby? His eyes widened as he remembered that Taehyung had pinned his worth at 8,000,000 won.</p>
<p class="text">'Holy shit,' Jimin thought to himself with wide eyes, staring down at the screen. 'Oh my god?'</p>
<div class="chat">
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">MYG is typing...</div>

<p class="text">JIMIN WAS LOSING HIS GODDAMN MIND. He couldn't believe he was genuinely considering the pros and cons of this; was he becoming Taehyung, king of all bad ideas? Drunken lord of terrible mistakes and walks of shame, except it was usually less from someone's house and more from out of a dumpster that he'd dived into of his own volition the night before? What was he thinking, even considering this?</p>

<p class="text">Tossing his phone on his bed, Jimin got up and paced the small space of his bedroom in a circle.</p>
<p class="text">Running his hands through his hair, he wondered if he should call Taehyung and ask him for his advice, before immediately dismissing the idea. It's not like Taehyung would do anything but literally encourage him to stay in Seoul by sucking some dick anyway.</p>
<p class="text">Well. Not true. Taehyung would definitely be worried about what sort of person MYG was.</p>
<p class="text">Chewing his lip nervously, Jimin glanced at his phone and winced as it buzzed with a new message from the... Stranger? Internet friend? Possible future sugar daddy? "Oh my god," he whined aloud, stomping across the room and flopping onto his bed like a 5 year old. Inhaling deeply, he checked what MYG had to say.</p>

</div>
<p class="text">WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT THE FUCK. Jimin's breath stopped short before he remembered exactly how much money 8,000,000 won was. Cocking his head, his brows pinched together and he was narrowed his eyes at his phone screen suspiciously.</p>
<div class="chat">
	<div class="msg sent" data-time="MINIMIN">no offence but</div>

	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">Give me your account number, I'll have my PA wire the money to you.</div>
</div>
<p class="text">Jimin snorted, resting on his back now as he lifted his phone above his face to continue chatting with MYG. Well, technically giving out his account number wouldn't be a problem; it's not like anyone could hack into it as long as they didn't know his PIN number--- If MYG had asked for his debit card number, that would have been ridiculous though.</p>
<p class="text">Giving away his address was a little more risky, but it wasn't like Jimin was expecting to stay in Seoul for more than a few hours; he'd already bought a ticket for the bus back to Busan online.</p>
<p class="text">Humming, Jimin went to the maps app on his phone and typed in his postal code, taking a screenshot. There was a brief moment of hesitation, but he grit his teeth and decided to send the address. It wasn't like anything could happen to him even if MYG sent his PA--- Jimin had been a PA, for fuck's sake. What was the guy going to do; threaten him with an annual report? Throw staplers at him if he refused to go with him?</p>
<div class="chat">

	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">MYG is typing...</div>
</div>
<p class="text">And Jimin waited, but there didn't seem to be any response coming after a while. Letting out a sigh, he balked at the time and realized he'd been lazing around for over 30 minutes already. "Shit," he hissed, jumping off the bed and locking his phone. He had too much to do to sit around negotiating pipe dreams with MYG, whoever he was.</p>
<p class="text">Running out to the kitchen, he pulled open a drawer to get a pair of scissors and a new roll of tape, determined to get back to work without distractions.</p>
<p class="divide">•·······•·······•·······•·······•</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi knew that Jungkook was a great PA, which was why he could trust him with this. "I need you to pick up someone for me," he said casually as they entered the lift. They were on the way to Yoongi's 5 o'clock; he'd managed to wrap up the rerecording with ILGI without too many issues.</p>
<p class="text">"Take him to my apartment, along with his things... Can you settle it? I'll take a cab back from 10Asia." Hopefully MINIMIN didn't have too many things; Yoongi would hate to trouble Jungkook too much. Multiple trips would be a pain.</p>
<p class="text">Jungkook glanced at him, hitting the button for the basement. The doors shut slowly. "Sure; just send me the address." He watched the bright red numbers on the elevator display change as they went downwards. "Who is it?"</p>
<p class="text">"A sugar baby," Yoongi said blandly, sending Jungkook the screenshot from MINIMIN.</p>
<p class="text">Choking on his own saliva, Jungkook pressed a hand on the door to stabilize himself.</p>
<p class="text">"Careful," Yoongi frowned. "If the doors open while your hand is on it, you'll get hurt---"</p>
<p class="text">"MIN-PD--- Hyung!" Jungkook hissed, glancing around the small lift like he was expecting someone to magically appear. Yoongi stared at him, bewildered. It was rare for Jungkook to call him so familiarly while they were still on office grounds, and it usually meant he was really jarred by something. "Are you serious? Why are you--- Why did you---"</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi exited the lift first, walking briskly to the Audi he'd given Jungkook last year. "Namjoon and Jin were nagging the shit out of me a couple of days ago, so I bought someone to talk to," he said breezily. It wasn't... Strictly true, or even the entire story, but Jungkook didn't need to be bothered with the minor details. The car doors unlocked, and Yoongi slid into the passenger's seat--- A long time ago, Kookie used to tell him to sit in the back because he was technically still his boss, but Yoongi hadn't wanted to. They hadn't had that argument in a long time, which was great. "He's nice, and he cooks. He listens to ILGI, so he can't be a bad person."</p>
<p class="text">"For the last time, you can't just--- Hyung," Jungkook groaned, resting his forehead on the steering wheel for a moment and massaging his temples. "I know I've told you this before, but just because someone listens to ILGI, it doesn't necessarily mean they're a good person."</p>
<p class="text">"How could they be bad if they listen to good music?" Yoongi scoffed, flapping a hand at Jungkook. "Quick, I don't want to be late."</p>
<p class="text">Starting the engine, Jungkook still appeared unappeased. "You're being too careless about this. In the first place, a sugar baby?" He made a groaning sound that grated on Yoongi's nerves as the car slowly came to life. The PA eased them out of the lot, his hands accustomed to the motions of leaving the building even if his mind was a complete mess. Muscle memory was truly an amazing thing. "Why can't you go out and pick up someone like a normal person?"</p>
<p class="text">"I don't think I've been a normal person in years, for one thing," Yoongi said dryly. He took out his phone and hit his iBanking app, glancing at MINIMIN's account number on his hand. He'd scrawled it into his skin with a black sharpie earlier, but hadn't had the time to make the transfer till now. "And at least this way it's anonymous; they don't actually know who I am." It cut out the initial worries he'd had--- That someone would date him for his connections. This way, he only had to worry about money, and it was just a fixed amount, which was kind of great. Very convenient.</p>
<p class="text">Jungkook glanced at him with wide eyes at the parking gantry, waiting for the bar to lift so that the car could pass through. "Anonymous? He doesn't know who you are?"</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi shook his head, pressing his thumb on the home button of his iPhone. Half a second in and he was already on a page listing his latest transactions; technology sure was amazing. "Nope. Though technically, now that I think about it, I guess he could be lying too." His brow furrowed as he turned to Jungkook. "Do you think he could be lying? He had pictures on his profile though."</p>
<p class="text">His PA gaped at him for a long time, even after the parking barrier was raised. It wasn't till a car came up behind them and honked that Jungkook snapped back to reality, jerking the car into motion and taking them out onto the main street. "Oh my god, of COURSE he could be lying!" Frustrated, he glared at Yoongi through the rear-view mirror. "Hyung, this is really dangerous, you know?!</p>
<p class="text">What if he robs you when I take him to your house? What if he's a predator?"</p>
<p class="text">"What the fuck is he going to steal, my goddamn washing machine? My dishwasher?" Yoongi snorted. "And what the hell is a predator?"</p>
<p class="text">"May I remind you, your apartment has tons of top of the line stuff," Jungkook deadpanned, slowing at an intersection. "Even if there's nothing like money, don't you have watches and stuff? Those are pretty expensive." The car stilled as they waited for the light to turn green again, Yoongi taking the time to finish his transaction to MINIMIN. "And predators--- I don't know, okay?" He ran a hand through his hair, wrenching it with annoyance. "A sexual predator? Maybe he's violent? How would you even know these things?!"</p>
<p class="text">"We don't, so you need to relax," Yoongi said slowly, kind of alarmed. He hadn't seen Jungkook this riled up in a while. "You okay there?"</p>
<p class="text">"No, I am not okay, I am the opposite of okay because my hyung has no sense of self preservation, whatsoever!" Jungkook exclaimed, laughing sarcastically as the traffic began to move again. He took them into a slow crawl behind a van, exasperated. "What if he goes in wielding a knife? How would you know if he tries to kill you in your sleep?"</p>
<p class="text">"Jesus Christ, you're maudlin," Yoongi stared, appalled. He locked his phone and pocketed it.</p>
<p class="text">"Look, he's in a pinch. We've been talking and he seems like a good guy who's just down on his luck. I don't know how long it'll last, but I've decided to take the guy in, alright?" Sighing, he pulled his satchel onto his lap and put on his glasses. "Don't make it a bigger deal than it is; and don't tell Jin-hyung or Joonie. Hoseok, too." He'd tell them himself. The reaction he got from Jungkook was quite enough for today.</p>
<p class="text">"This is a big deal; you're offering to pay someone for their company here," Jungkook argued heatedly, taking a left and cruising onto the highway. Luckily, they were on the road just before rush hour--- The traffic wasn't too terrible... Yet. "I get that it's hard for you to meet people, but isn't this going a little too fast? I'm just worried about you, hyung."</p>
<p class="text">"Since when did you ever have to worry about me?" Yoongi huffed, pulling up a transcript of PAROXCISM's last radio interview; Namjoon had emailed it to him and highlighted the finer points.</p>
<p class="text">Good press, bad press, things the members said while they were on their own--- These were all things they still had to consider. Producers never really had a moment to rest, especially not when their groups were so young. Established idols like GD-sunbaenim and Shinee-sunbaenim were fine on their own, but Yoongi wasn't letting his focus slip till their groups were on the same playing field.</p>
<p class="text">"It'll be fine; just trust me. If he's an asshole, it's not like I'll put up with it."</p>
<p class="text">Jungkook glanced at him. "You put up with a lot of nonsense, though."</p>
<p class="text">"That's because it's my job," Yoongi said defensively, which was objectively true. "I have to. But no one's paying me to tolerate jack shit when I'm on my own time, right?"</p>
<p class="text">Wearily, the PA let out a long sigh. "I just hope you know what you're doing, hyung." Jungkook glanced over at his boss. "Even setting aside the fact that he could turn out to be a complete jerk, there's still the matter of confidentiality. If this gets out into the news..." He worried his lip as he changed lanes, carefully signalling the cars behind them. "... I don't want things to get nasty for you, so please be more careful with what you do."</p>
<p class="text">Yoongi could tell Jungkook was genuinely concerned for him, but MINIMIN wasn't going to be a problem. The arrangement probably wasn't even going to last very long; the guy was likely already finding a job. Though he'd gone to all this trouble, Yoongi was just curious about why having a sugar baby was such a bad thing. More than anything, he was just in it for the experience--- This way he could simulate a relationship without the actual commitment of having to be in one. Namjoon had also mentioned that people sought out others on Seeking Arrangement purely for the company, so it wasn't like he had any bad intentions; he just hoped MINIMIN felt the same way.</p>
<p class="text">"Yeah. I'll be careful."</p>
<p class="divide">•·······•·······•·······•·······•</p>
<p class="text">Jimin was going to miss his bus if he didn't manage to tie the fucking knot on his sheets. Biting viciously into his lower lip, he narrowed his eyes at the bulk of his bedspreads, rolled up into a big bundle. He hadn't figured out how he was going to actually take this on the bus, but he'd think about that later. "Come on," he murmured, yanking the raffia string tightly to try and compress the sizeable bulk, wishing he'd thought to pick up some vacuum-seal bags. "Come on..."</p>
<p class="text">The doorbell rang, jarring him into letting go. His blankets and bed covers unfurled, and he let out a frustrated groan.</p>
<p class="text">The only person he could think of that would bother him at this time was his landlord or Taehyung, but Tae had just been freshly commissioned; it probably wasn't him. Crossing his apartment, he ran a hand through his hair and scowled, throwing the door open. "Ju-in-ssi, I'm in the middle of packing---"</p>
<p class="text">Standing on his doorstep was one of the finest goddamn specimens Jimin had ever seen in his life.</p>
<p class="text">His jaw dropping, he blinked and backtracked, a little alarmed on pure instinct. "Um," he blurted, completely stunned. "I---? What? I mean, hi?"</p>
<p class="text">The man awkwardly shifted on his feet, blinking warily at Jimin. "Hello," he greeted, clearing his throat. "My name is Jungkook. May---" He cocked his head at Jimin. "May I come in?"</p>
<p class="text">Why? Who was this man? Did god pay a little more attention when he was making him? What did Jimin have to do in order to get that tall? "Yeah, yes, sure," he found himself saying, despite not having any answers. Seriously, his head was full of question marks. Jungkook stepped into his small apartment and Jimin quickly barred the door, locking it and spinning on his heel to face the stranger in his home. "Um... I'm sorry it's a bit messy, but I'm moving out of here," he explained, wincing at the mess. "Can I--- Would you like to have some water?"</p>
<p class="text">"No, thank you," Jungkook responded, looking out of place in his pressed suit. The cut of it accentuated his broad shoulders, and he had his fingers hooked into his loafers. He placed them on the ground beside Jimin's red Converse. "Please don't trouble yourself." Glancing around, he seemed to be assessing everything, his eyes sharp and attentive. "Have you packed everything?"</p>
<p class="text">"I---" Jimin stared at him. "Um. No? Almost?" He managed to refrain from listing the things he hadn't yet packed - the fucking enormous stuffed dog, the million facial products he used on the regular - but couldn't help but blurt, "excuse me, but who are you?"</p>
<p class="text">Jungkook seemed to expect this question from the speed with which Jimin was presented with a business card. "I work with your... I work with MYG-ssi," he said, a tad uncomfortably. The card had no logo, and it was only printed with Jungkook's name and number. Beneath his name, the position PERSONAL ASSISTANT was embellished in rose gold. "I'm his PA; he sent me to help you move your things and settle the matter of your rent with your landlord." Almost as though he felt the need to prove it, he drew an envelope out from the inner pocket of his suit jacket, wriggling it between his fingers. It was fat, presumably stuffed with notes.</p>
<p class="text">For a long moment, Jimin gaped at him. Jungkook seemed completely at ease, but his world was presently on the verge of being tipped upside down. "W-What?" He croaked dryly, disbelievingly. "What did you say?"</p>
<p class="text">"I'm MYG-ssi's PA," Jungkook said, very slowly like Jimin was a dense child with a myriad of learning difficulties. "He sent me to help you move---"</p>
<p class="text">"OH MY GOD?!" Jimin burst out, sputtering as he back-pedalled, slamming himself back up against a wall. "I heard what you said, but--- What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?! Are you serious?! I'm--- WHAT THE FUCK?!"</p>
<p class="text">Jungkook's eyes widened and he held up his hands in the universal gesture of surrender. "Mi-Minimin-ssi, please calm down---"</p>
<p class="text">"I CAN'T--- What the hell---" Jimin rasped, clutching his head as he tried to process exactly what was happening. Had he seriously--- Did MYG really--- "Are you kidnapping me?" He whimpered, panicking as he stumbled over a box of comic books he'd wanted to drop off at Taehyung's. "Is this how I die? If I refuse to go, are you going to put a cloth over my face and make me pass out?"</p>
<p class="text">"I don't have any chloroform," Jungkook answered immediately, before his face colored with regret. "Wait, I didn't mean to say---"</p>
<p class="text">"OH MY GOD," Jimin shrieked again, vaulting over the back of his sofa and locking himself into his own room. He grabbed the nearest piece of furniture - his dresser - and dragged it in front of the door. Jungkook looked strong, but there was no way he could get in, right? Not with a dresser in the way. Only mildly satisfied, Jimin looked around nervously for something he could arm himself with, just in case. "GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!"</p>
<p class="text">The knock that came was almost timid. "Minimin-ssi, please unlock the door," Jungkook pleaded. He sounded tired. "This is all supremely unnecessary--- I'll let you talk to my boss, if that reassures you."</p>
<p class="text">"Is that supposed to convince me you're not going to take me by force?! I don't even know you, except for the fact you could be a Calvin Klein model if you wanted to be!" Jimin yelled back, breathing heavily as he dived for his phone on his bed. "I can't believe he actually--- You know, some people just don't know how to take a joke, it's 2017, I should be able to live in peace without being FORCEFULLY REMOVED FROM MY OWN HOUSE---" He unlocked it, frantically opening the Seeking Arrangement app and intending to yell at MYG via the text messaging system.</p>
<p class="text">He halted, however, when he saw a new message from an hour and a half ago.</p>
<div class="chat">
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">I'm done with the transfer. MY PA, Jungkook, will pick you up within the hour.</div>
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">He'll settle your rent too, so don't worry about anything.</div>
	<div class="msg rcvd" data-time="MYG">I'll see you later.</div>
</div>
<p class="text">No way. There was no goddamn way. He closed Seeking Arrangement with trembling fingers, opening his iBanking app and keying in his PIN number. Numbly, he closed all the promotional ads for credit and loaded his account summary, closing his eyes. Counting to ten very, very slowly, he opened them.</p>
<p class="text">8,096,195 won.</p>
<p class="text">Jimin was so fucking stumped he actually said, "you were supposed to be here an hour ago," out aloud.</p>
<p class="text">"Yes," Jungkook responded wryly on the other side of his bedroom door, "but the traffic was terrible, and the parking here sucks."</p>
<p class="text">Swallowing thickly, Jimin stared at his account balance. This was insane--- Everything was insane.</p>
<p class="text">His life, right now, was fucking insane. He had no idea how this had happened; he hadn't thought MYG was being serious, or he'd never have given out his account details. God, he'd been so, so stupid. He wasn't sure how he was going to fix this, but he was at least sure of one thing.</p>
<p class="text">Jungkook stepped backwards as Jimin dragged his dresser back and unlocked the door. He looked at him patiently, like he was expecting a nervous breakdown of some sort. It was probably just prudent of him, because Jimin thought it was entirely possible he was going to have one.</p>
<p class="text">"Okay," he said quietly, trying to regulate his breathing and calm down. "I think I need to speak to your boss."</p>
<p class="text">"I've always been very mindful of my words to them," Yoongi told the interviewer calmly, his fingers interlaced on the table. This wasn't this first rodeo with 10Asia, and she was a familiar face---</p>
<p class="text">It made the entire meeting go far more smoothly. It also helped that this was a printed interview rather than a recorded one; B:ENT and 10Asia had a standing agreement that he could sign off on any printed articles before it went into their magazine, which meant there was lower risk of bad press. "Where it comes to their popularity, ILGI has always displayed a humbled attitude, which I think is endearing to ENTRIES all over the world."</p>
<p class="text">"Your group is very active on Twitter," the interviewer read warmly with a smile. "Other than using it as a medium to talk to their fans, they've also interacted with many idols, especially their PAROXCISM dongsaengs."</p>
<p class="text">"Namjoon encourages all our artists to maintain an open door policy," Yoongi explained, feeling his phone buzzing. Inclining his head apologetically, he waited for a nod before he dug it out of his pocket. "Neither ILGI nor PAROXCISM have anything to hide, and naturally, they both want to show as much appreciation to their fans as possible. With social media, it becomes possible. And while they're young and growing as artists, we also want them to form long-lasting and fruitful friendships--- Whether or not those peers are from the same industry." He frowned when he saw Jungkook's name on his screen; his PA hardly ever called him during his appointments unless it was an emergency--- Had something gone wrong? "Please excuse my rudeness," he said to the interviewer guiltily, standing. "I really need to take this."</p>
<p class="text">"No problem at all," she said, lowering the screen of her laptop. "Please, take all the time you need, Min Yoongi-ssi."</p>
<p class="text">He accepted the call and left the room, looking around for a secluded area so that he could speak to Jungkook privately. "Hello?" He said quietly. "I'm still with Asia10. Is everything alright?"</p>
<p class="text">"He's freaking out," Jungkook said dryly, his tone unamused even through the line. "He thinks I'll kill him if he doesn't come, and he's completely losing it. I'm sorry for interrupting your interview, but I said I'd let him talk to you."</p>
<p class="text">Sighing heavily, Yoongi ducked into an empty conference room and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p class="text">"Alright, that's fine. I'll settle this." There was a rustling sound as Jungkook presumably passed the phone, and Yoongi was a little surprised when the line stayed quiet even after the static had stopped.</p>
<p class="text">"... MINIMIN?" He spoke cautiously, wondering why his nerves were kicking in. He could feel his heart rate going up, and it was confusing--- He was essentially talking to a stranger, after all.</p>
<p class="text">"It--- It's Jimin." The voice that came over the line was subdued and filled with concern, but lilting and a little slurred with satoori. Somehow, his voice sounded kind of sweet. "My name, it's--- It's Park Jimin."</p>
<p class="text">Smiling, Yoongi walked up to the floor to ceiling windows and stared out at Seoul's evening skyline.</p>
<p class="text">He couldn't give out his family name just yet--- he wanted to meet Jimin first, at least. Still... "It's nice to meet you, Jimin. My name is Yoongi, and I hope my PA doesn't scare you too much." Chuckling, he folded his left arm over his abdomen and rested his right elbow on his wrist. "I promise you that he's harmless, even if he does look a little, ah, menacing." Sometimes Yoongi forgot that Jungkook was capable of doing that thing--- Scaring people and shit. It had been awhile; everyone at the company knew the guy was a giant softy.</p>
<p class="text">"Yoongi."</p>
<p class="text">Lifting an eyebrow, he glanced at the receiver of his phone. "Yes?" Yoongi responded, a little confused.</p>
<p class="text">"Oh," Jimin breathed, sounding a little taken aback. "No, no. I was just... It's nothing. I mean! It's your name," he clarified nervously. "I just... I wanted to call you... By your name."</p>
<p class="text">This guy was cute. Yoongi laughed quietly, pacing the length of the conference table before rounding on his heel. "Well, Min," he said teasingly, "You can call me by my name later. I promise you that everything is going to be taken care of, so for now, can you just follow Jungkook? He'll take you back to my apartment so that you can get settled in and I'll see you later tonight, okay?"</p>
<p class="text">"I--- This is..." Jimin trailed off. There was a short lull in which neither of them said anything, before Jimin seemed to get himself together. "8,000,000 won, I... Yoongi," he protested, embarrassment coloring his tone, "it's a lot of money."</p>
<p class="text">"Well, yes," Yoongi said calmly, checking the time on his watch. He still had more work to do back at B:ENT, so he needed to wrap this up quickly if he wanted to get home earlier. They'd probably need some time to talk, and lay out some ground rules once Jimin found out who Yoongi really was and how important it was that his reputation wasn't jeopardized. "But it was stated on your profile that your monthly salary was 8---"</p>
<p class="text">"Yoongi!" Jimin whined. "Seriously, this amount of money is too much, I can't---"</p>
<p class="text">"But I remember you saying you were worth every jeon?" Yoongi reminded with a grin. He was getting quite a kick out of making Jimin flustered, actually. "If you're so concerned about it, then prove it to me."</p>
<p class="text">Jimin sputtered. There was a rustling before Jungkook's voice trilled down the line. "I assume everything's been fixed?" He asked dryly. "He's over here looking a bit like a guppy, his lips are doing... A thing."</p>
<p class="text">"Don't look at my sugar baby's lips," Yoongi snorted, just to make Jungkook massively uncomfortable--- Another person he lived to rile up. "See that he gets everything he needs," he added, before he finally hung up. Yoongi had an interview to finish.</p>
<p class="text">Jungkook pocketed his phone, turning to look at Jimin. The man was still gaping like a fish, completely flabbergasted. Jungkook could relate; Yoongi tended to do that to a lot of people. "Well," he said conversationally, lowering himself and picking up a roll of tape near his foot. "I guess that's that." He journeyed towards Jimin's bedroom and looked around, picking out the stuffed dog in a heartbeat and lifting an eyebrow. "I'll help you out with your packing; what else do you need to bring?"</p>
<p class="text">Slowly, Jimin wandered into his own room dazed eyes. "I--- I have a microwave," he said nonsensically, making Jungkook frown. They weren't even in the kitchen.
