# Dream Journal
## Atomize
Ok so this one is unedited. It's straight brain to paper after a dream, so the writing will get better.

### The Story
#### Village Arc
> It all starts in the village at the edge of a large empire. The empire consists of thousands of medium to small islands, each with their own distinct magical abilities.
We are in the body of a young man. While unexpecting on the outside, he holds within him a big secret. He is one of the last Oracles to ever exist. His younger sister, back home at the capital, is the only other one. When they were younger, the youngest was cursed to experience his ailments on a smaller scale. And while you can treat him from afar through his sister, the two do not wish to be life bound anymore. Earlier in the year, we had received a prophetic dream that the small village we are now in was important.
Finding the cure is not the only goal here in this village. You see, we work in a secret three person organization. Along with the Second Crown Prince and the Royal Mage. The three of us had received word that there was unrest in the village. So the SCP sent his most trustworthy knight, with the promise of taking care of his sister, there to spy.
We join the knight at the tail end of a meeting with the SCP and the RM. The SCP had already returned to his duties, but the RM and the OK are still speaking. Speaking puts it lightly, having a relationship spat is more like it. The RM is no Oracle, but they have one of the best intuitions on the planet. And his instincts are going haywire with their partner practically on the other side of the kingdom. In a place he's never been too, so he can't teleport when something goes wrong. And his trying to tell the OK that he needs to get out of there. Stat.
But our poor OK is very stubborn. And he has two missions here, and he's going to complete them. And we're a damn oracle, and our dreams told us to be here. We'll be fine. But of course, his dear RM is, as usual, right. And a few minutes after ending communications, the village is attacked. Attacked by a mysterious demon army. With hellhounds. Many, many hellhounds. The OK barely manages to make it out alive. And he's still being followed by a few of the demonic hounds. He has enough time to send out an "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message, before he has to cut communications out of fear of being tracked by the more, logical, creatures.

#### Return Arc
> So now we're on the run on foot. Any other form of transportation was either killed or destroyed. Fun fact about hellhounds, they have 4 legs and are very fast. We may be very fast, but we only have two legs. So the chase is long and harrowing. Not long after the beginning, we realize there something else with four legs following us. But it doesn't have the same demonic energy as the other beasts following us. And while we lose the hellhounds somehow, this animal is still making a beeline for us.
While we're hurriedly trying to make a boat. A headless dog bursts into the clearing. And we discover what the real purpose of that town was. The CP was attempting to create an army of unkillable creatures. And started experiments with small rodents. And had worked his way up to dogs. This pupper was the only success. Sensing no ill will coming from it, we allow it to climb up in our backpack, and we make haste across the water.
We arrive back in the capital, through not exactly legal means. Concerned about the headless nature of our new dog, we craft him a head, and with a little magic and a blue handkerchief, we have a totally completely normal Pyrenees dog.
On the way back up to the castle through the catacombs, we are stopped by the CP's men. Who attempt to arrest us under the pretense of us being the cause of the destruction of the village. And also tried to take our dog. Which is honestly bullshit and everyone there knew it. Lucky for us, we were then teleported into the RM's chamber, where the aforementioned mage, the TWO CP's and our sister were waiting.

### Others
#### Character Descriptions
> CP - (Crown Prince) An older version of SCP with black hair and frown lines.
SCP - (Second Crown Prince) Kind of looks like my Laurence Sim
RM - (Royal Mage) Starborn, but has two human forms. His day to day is one emo bitch. Black hair, eye circles, gothic robes the whole nine yards. The form he uses for public appearances is basically the same as Phobos from W.I.T.C.H.  
His Star form basically blurs the edges of his human form. And his physical features are covered with a myriad of galaxies and stars. *Note: Insert Photos later*
OK - (Oracle Knight) We never really saw ourselves, up to whatever you want.
OS - (Oracle Saint) Zelda but with longer blonde hair and slightly softer features (we don't have to be identical, but we are twins)

#### RM Thoughts
>Imagine you're the RM. And the last conversation you had with your partner was telling him he needs to leave a dangerous situation and he ignored you. And you ended the communications on a sour note. And you're trying to go about your duties, keeping your mind off of worrying about him. Cause, youâ€™re the great Royal Mage! You can't show sign of distress.

Now, as your looking down upon the tea gathering in the gardens from the tower. You see the SCP come hastily in, with a grim look on his face, and making a beeline for the OS. And they have quick conversation, and they both start heading towards your tower. So you check comms, and see the "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message. As well as the "connection lost" message. How would that make you feel?

1. Vindictive that you were right all along.
2. Panicking. Cause where the fuck is your partner.
3. Angry. Where the fuck is my partner. I'm going to burn down a small unnecessary building.
4. Let's go the logic route. We're finding this fucker and I'm smacking the shit out of him.
