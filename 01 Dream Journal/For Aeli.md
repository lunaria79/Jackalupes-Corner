# Dream Journal
## Atomize
Ok so this one is unedited. It's straight brain to paper after a dream, so the writing will get better.
### The Story
#### Village Arc
> It all starts in the village at the edge of a large empire. The empire consists of thousands of medium to small islands, each with their own distinct magical abilities.
<br>We are in the body of a young man. While unexpecting on the outside, he holds within him a big secret. He is one of the last Oracles to ever exist. His younger sister, back home at the capital, is the only other one. When they were younger, the youngest was cursed to experience his ailments on a smaller scale. And while you can treat him from afar through his sister, the two do not wish to be life bound anymore. Earlier in the year, we had received a prophetic dream that the small village we are now in was important.
<br>Finding the cure is not the only goal here in this village. You see, we work in a secret three person organization. Along with the Second Crown Prince and the Royal Mage. The three of us had received word that there was unrest in the village. So the SCP sent his most trustworthy knight, with the promise of taking care of his sister, there to spy.
<br>We join the knight at the tail end of a meeting with the SCP and the RM. The SCP had already returned to his duties, but the RM and the OK are still speaking. Speaking puts it lightly, having a relationship spat is more like it. The RM is no Oracle, but they have one of the best intuitions on the planet. And his instincts are going haywire with their partner practically on the other side of the kingdom. In a place he's never been too, so he can't teleport when something goes wrong. And his trying to tell the OK that he needs to get out of there. Stat.
<br> But our poor OK is very stubborn. And he has two missions here, and he's going to complete them. And we're a damn oracle, and our dreams told us to be here. We'll be fine. But of course, his dear RM is, as usual, right. And a few minutes after ending communications, the village is attacked. Attacked by a mysterious demon army. With hellhounds. Many, many hellhounds. The OK barely manages to make it out alive. And he's still being followed by a few of the demonic hounds. He has enough time to send out an "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message, before he has to cut communications out of fear of being tracked by the more, logical, creatures.
#### Return Arc
> So now we're on the run on foot. Any other form of transportation was either killed or destroyed. Fun fact about hellhounds, they have 4 legs and are very fast. We may be very fast, but we only have two legs. So the chase is long and harrowing. Not long after the beginning, we realize there something else with four legs following us. But it doesn't have the same demonic energy as the other beasts following us. And while we lose the hellhounds somehow, this animal is still making a beeline for us.
<br>While we're hurriedly trying to make a boat. A headless dog bursts into the clearing. And we discover what the real purpose of that town was. The CP was attempting to create an army of unkillable creatures. And started experiments with small rodents. And had worked his way up to dogs. This pupper was the only success. Sensing no ill will coming from it, we allow it to climb up in our backpack, and we make haste across the water.
<br>We arrive back in the capital, through not exactly legal means. Concerned about the headless nature of our new dog, we craft him a head, and with a little magic and a blue handkerchief, we have a totally completely normal Pyrenees dog.
<br> On the way back up to the castle through the catacombs, we are stopped by the CP's men. Who attempt to arrest us under the pretense of us being the cause of the destruction of the village. And also tried to take our dog. Which is honestly bullshit and everyone there knew it. Lucky for us, we were then teleported into the RM's chamber, where the aforementioned mage, the TWO CP's and our sister were waiting.

### Others
#### Character Descriptions
> CP - (Crown Prince) An older version of SCP with black hair and frown lines.
<br>SCP - (Second Crown Prince) Kind of looks like my Laurence Sim
<br>RM - (Royal Mage) Starborn, but has two human forms. His day to day is one emo bitch. Black hair, eye circles, gothic robes the whole nine yards. The form he uses for public appearances is basically the same as Phobos from W.I.T.C.H.  
<br>His Star form basically blurs the edges of his human form. And his physical features are covered with a myriad of galaxies and stars. *Note: Insert Photos later*
<br>OK - (Oracle Knight) We never really saw ourselves, up to whatever you want.
<br>OS - (Oracle Saint) Zelda but with longer blonde hair and slightly softer features (we don't have to be identical, but we are twins)
#### RM Thoughts
> Imagine you're the RM. And the last conversation you had with your partner was telling him he needs to leave a dangerous situation and he ignored you. And you ended the communications on a sour note. And you're trying to go about your duties, keeping your mind off of worrying about him. Cause, you’re the great Royal Mage! You can't show sign of distress.
<br>Now, as your looking down upon the tea gathering in the gardens from the tower. You see the SCP come hastily in, with a grim look on his face, and making a beeline for the OS. And they have quick conversation, and they both start heading towards your tower. So you check comms, and see the "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message. As well as the "connection lost" message. How would that make you feel?
>> 1. Vindictive that you were right all along.
>>  2. Panicking. Cause where the fuck is your partner.
>>  3. Angry. Where the fuck is my partner. I'm going to burn down a small unnecessary building.
>>  4. Let's go the logic route. We're finding this fucker and I'm smacking the shit out of him.
#### The Letter
> Hello everyone, you might have noticed that I'm not in the castle. Today, as I'm sure you've heard from REDACTED that we've both received the prophecy of the destruction of the kingdom. But more importantly, I guess I should explain how I got down here. I woke up with the most devastating headache I've ever had. Now that I think about it, it was probably a migraine. I digress. All I knew was that I had to get down to the docks. Now I might have scared some of our citizens with the sluggish way I was walking. But it's a bit too late now. We have more pressing matters at hand. Which I'll get to in a minute.
<br>When I arrived at the docks, as soon as I set foot on wood planks it's made of, my mind was flung forward. And an influx of information greeted my third eye. The demons are just across the horizon. And their army has grown. Those killed by them are taking up as thralls. There are more hellhounds than ever before. This is not a battle that can be won. I strongly recommend we evacuate everyone, citizens and soldiers alike.
<br>This may come as a surprise to you, but I've decided to stay. My mind is clearing as these two excellent young fellows are writing. And it's my duty to protect this kingdom to my dying breath. Ergo, I'm staying and you can't convince me otherwise. So I am to write down my last words to you.
<br>**REDACTED**: You have been one of my closest friends since childhood. And since then, I knew that you would make a much better king than that bitch of a brother. Growing up alongside of you was one of the happiest experiences in my life. From beating you in horse races, to beating to you in hunting competitions to beating you in finding love first, I have loved one upping you in every aspect in life. I jest. You're the closest thing to an older brother I have ever had. And for that I love and adore you. Please do not miss me when I'm gone. I'm going to haunt your ass, so we can continue pilfering the kitchens for the rest of our lives.
<br> **REDACTED**: My beloved baby sister. I'm sorry for all of the pain I have caused you over the years. Physically and mentally. It seems to the very end I was unable to cure you of that damn curse. And for that, I will apologize for the rest of eternity. I know that I haven't said it enough growing up but I love you. Since the death of our parents, it's been you and me against the world, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Please forget anything mean I said during puberty, I didn't mean any of it. I was lashing out at the wrong person. It's something I'll never forgive myself for. As you continue on to be the last oracle living, I hope the rest of your prophecies be merry.
<br>**REDACTED**: Hey love. I know you're probably mad at me. And you should be. Making this decision without your input. But I feel like it was important to do. I'm sorry that our last few conversations have been arguments due to my own pig headed behavior.  I'm sorry that I'm throwing a massive wrench in our plans for the future. You didn't ask for such an idiot of a boyfriend did you. I love you too the moons and back, and then some. May I forever last in your memory, as I speak your name as my final breath.

## Gaia's Wrath
### The Story
> Two girls are suddenly captured by a portal, and are transported to a tropical island full of strange Pokémon. As they walk through the forest, unafraid, many Pokémon approached them in curiosity. Eventually, a Pokémon that look similar to a bear cub stained yellow, approached them with a gleam of higher intelligence in his eye. It leads them to a group of 5 Guys, who in turn lead them to the scientist that is the defacto leader of the island. The scientist, being there the longest (since the 1600s), has gone crazy, but is loving it. Spends most of her days talking to her plants and doing experiments. However, Gaia doesn't see her fit to be a leader, and tries to take charge. Janet stands awkwardly behind everyone.
<br> While **Gaia** and **the scientist** were talking, **Sun** lead **Janet** to a crystal hatch that had mysteriously opened. Upon leading her to **Moon**, the two cubs initiated a soul contract with **Janet**, and they were so cute she had to accept. After the contract is finished, she exits the hatch and immediately runs in to **the scientist**. **The scientist** explains how never could figure out how to open the hatch, and gave up trying when starting to focus on survival. When arriving back at **the scientists** home, Gaia is consumed by jealousy, as she had been wanting to keep **Sun** as a pet. She was trying to convince one of the **Five Guys** to give her one of their few pokéballs. As **Gaia** watches the three interact, she grows angrier and angrier, and plants start to grow out of her body, beautiful and deadly.
<br>Fed up with her attitude, **Janet** rightfully points out **Gaia's** selfishness, which causes the young women to detonate. How dare **Janet** speak to her in that way? As she erupts in anger, **Gaia** attacks **Janet**, trying to steal her bears.

### Characters
#### Gaia
> **Gaia** is quite a popular girl, whose used to getting her way. Her and **Janet** were good friends, however, having known each other since the cradle days. When the island starts affecting their minds, she becomes consumed by her anger at not being the special one for once.

#### Janet
> Janet is significantly less popular than **Gaia**, and kept to her self. She loves **Gaia**, but entering school has seriously changed her from the kind and loving child she once knew. The island didn't affect her mind like **Gaia** and **the scientist**, as it had chosen her as it's **deity [subject to change]** .

#### Sun & Moon
> **Sun** and **Moon** are the twin familiars that are chosen for Janet. **Sun** is a very excitable and demanding cub, always wanting to be held. **Moon** spends most of her days sleeping, but when more awake is very sweet and cuddly.

#### The Scientist
> All that is known about **The Scientist** is that she was transported to the island during a car crash after she and her team broke their team lead out of jail. She does not know what happened to the others.

#### 5 Guys
> Straight up, there are five guys just randomly here. They seemed nice, and were very kind.

## Isle of the Gods
> What was supposed to be an easy dungeon exploration leaves a adventure part marooned on a deserted island. A mysterious force is mysteriously picking of members on by one until there are only five left.
<br> two party members start off on the wrong foot and get on each others nerves. surprise surprise in the end they are married.
<br> there's a slightly pompous older guy that's in charge of the expedition.
<br> turns out he's an elder god that has deluded himself into believing our main girl is his wife and property.
<br> and the whole island adventure was a big ruse, and he was sacrificing the party members in order to turn her into a minor god to marry.
<br>after "killing" the guy she actually had become good friends with and trauma bonded with, with an ancient elevator (dreams are wack yall, he was crushed to death because he pushed us out of it cause he
<br>saw it was a trap. it was in excruciating detail. i love my dreams)
<br>he then kidnaps her and takes her to the realm of the gods where he forces her into marrying him by
<br>threatening her life. parades her around like a doll before the ceremony.
<br>the only person kinda on her side is a minor god dress seamstress that vows to take as long on the dress as possible, so she can either plan her escape and have a moment to herself before her inevitable
<br>captivity. she eventually gets drugged however, and the ceremony continues
<br>during the wedding ceremony, THE DEAD GUY SHOWS UP. turns out he's the douche gods younger brother, who was cast out of the realm for "reasons". and enacts a duel with the son of a bitch.
<br>gods have weird rules, so once a female god is married, she is off the market and no other gods can touch her, like at all physically. in her drugged stupor, she recognizes that her friend wont win the fight, and carefully carries on the ceremony to the point that to finish it they just have to drink from some chalice together
<br>and because they had been adventuring together for so long, the guy picks up on the plan. orchestrates a move where's blown backwards up the steps, abandons his weapon and drinks from the chalice with her.
<br>they both think that being married and maybe unhappy about it later was better than dead and/or tortured for a millennia.
<br>and then i woke up will plan more

## Trauma Central (Not Official)
### Story
> The group is getting ready to go to a fancy dinner and an interview with a huge asshole interviewer. The two sisters are working through their anxiety about it, and the men, while also anxious, are pretending everything is fine and rough housing. The manager has had the MC and the LI in a fake PR relationship, which at this point has every member going, "yeah... PR relationship....". It's not official yet or anything lmao.
<br> While waiting for the limo, the MC starts to get flashbacks, but wants to continue because she doesn't want to let the group down. (They would not have given a single shit, go take a sick day love we support you) So of course, she doesn't tell anyone, but both the LI and OS notice something is off. They both try to cheer her up by horsing around a little (Love Interest) and discussing the flora in the area (Older Sister). It works, and she returns to the present. For now.
<br> In the limo, the interviewer starts asking her probing rude questions about her past, causing her to start having more flashbacks. The rest of the group intervenes, and the interviewer is kicked out at a stop light.
<br> During the dinner, the MC spends most of it crying and having flashbacks in the private bathroom. Poor MC.

### Random Scene
> **Love Interest:** (half jokingly) Did you get lost and the hotel manager touch you?  
<br> **Main Character:** (half paying attention) Not this time.  
<br> **Love Interest:** (extremely seriously) What do you mean this time?  
<br> **Main Character:** Oh look I think our limo is here.  
<br> **Love Interest:** Wait--  
<br> (AS A WAY TO DEAL WITH HER TRUAMA, SHE LIKES TO JOKE ABOUT IT WITH HER SISTER AND BANDMATES. SHE IS FINE WITH THE JOKE, AND IF SHE WAS PAYING ATTENTION SHE PROBABLY WOULDVE LAUGHED)

### Random Scene
> As they arrive at the red carpet and step out, MC feels like her stomach is collapsing in on herself. On a regular day, she would've paid them no mind, but the camera flashes flings her mind back to her past. She feels like she's going to barf. Instinctively, she curls into the LI's side, and his arm raps around her protectively. He leans down and whispers in her ear, asking if she needs to leave. Her back straightens, her mind clears, and she assures him that she can handle this. It's only a matter of time until she crumbles again.

> > In my professional author opinion. Lord Ass wanted to leave Lady Lovely behind with Lord Sexc, whose a "famous womanizer" so that people could start rumors and ruin her reputation. But that also doesn't make sense with his later actions? Maybe Lord Ass is just dumb.

<br> However, Lord Ass moves are unpredictable. After the others return, Lord Ass corners Lady Lovely in the gardens, and proposes to her. Shellshocked, Lady Lovely just lets him ramble until she comes to her senses. She admits that she knows about the Asses plan to steal her estate, the plan to ruin her reputation, admits that she hasn't loved him in a long time, and declares their relationship over. In anger, he attacks her, knocking her to the ground and starting to choke her. Maid Snake, in witnessing this, bolts off to find help.
<br> Lord Sexc is minding his own business playing soccer with the boys™ when Maid Snake comes running up to him in hysterics. Only hearing the first half of her exclamation, Lord Sexc takes off towards the gardens, finding Lady Lovely almost passed out, and launches himself at Lord Sexc. In the commotion, Lady Lovely manages to gather up Lady Lovely and take her away to the hidden cottage near the lake. Together, the wait there until Lord Sexc bursts in with a doctor.

## Judas
### Plots
#### Befriending the Canaries
> **Adelaide** starts making friends in her classroom, when she was forced into a group project. **Cole** and the others seemed a bit uppity, but weren't rude so she liked them. She won them over with her hard work and treats she brought from home.
> 
> But for some fucking reason, her classmate **Alex** inserts himself in the group, demands she give him some of the noodles she had made, and when she didn't have any desert left to give him, broke into her backpack and stole some of her strawberry ice cream. She grabs him by the shirt, almost punches the daylights out of him, takes a deep breath, and then asks calmly (for her) why the hell he was behaving this way.
> 
> Presumably because he thought she had gone soft, Alex proceeds to attack the surrounding disciplinary students that were trying to intervene. Seeing **Alex** attack her new friends, **Adelaide** sees red and body slams him through a table. At this point the bell rings and **Alex** escapes into the fray. 
#### Bus #69
>  **Adelaide** was reassigned to a new bus (Bus #69) which turns out to be the same bus where all the pathetic misplaced nerds go. While never meeting her, all of the nerds are terrified of her due to her reputation.  An honestly really cute black girl named **Janet** was elected to try and stop her when she got on, but **Adelaide** says "It's kind of you to try and hug me, but we don't know each other well enough for that. "  (Our **Adelaide** is kind of dumb.) 
>  
>  **Adelaide** selects her seat towards the middle of the bus, which is later taken up by a strange tall blonde man, with a gleam in his eye. Reveals himself as **Matteo**, and starts asking strange questions, like "What do you like to do outside of school?" and "What do you think about these outfit ideas?". His friend named **Judas** regularly chimes in with a joke or anecdote. **Adelaide** is not entirely sure what's happening, but it feels nice so she lets it continue.
>  TBC
#### Judas Confrontation
> The funniest thing about the **Judas** Confrontation, is that while it's recorded, both **Judas** and **Matteo** are in maid bunny cosplay.
### Characters
#### Adelaide (Or something similar to that)
> The scariest person at the behavioral school. But she's really sweet if you try to get to know her. She's absolutely massive, like orc build. 6'5, built like a freight train. Long frizzy auburn hair with chiseled features. Likes baking and reading. Wolf autism. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but she's trying really hard. Doesn't understand why people are mean to her.
####  Matteo
> You remember that guy you saw at Sheetz? Multiply his twink by four. 6'8, incredibly wiry. Long blond hair, extremely pretty. Awkward as hell. Fashion autism but scared of being called gay. Not because he's homophobic, but the school is. Was terrified of Adelaide for 5 seconds and then, upon seeing model potential, instantly fell in love with her. He's *down bad* down bad. It's pathetic really. All he wants is muscle mommy with big hands. Regularly fantasizes about her edging him. What a freak. 
#### Judas
> on the shorter side, black hair and stubble. unassuming. good friends with **Matteo**. Gets along well with Adelaide.
> 
> FAKE ASS BITCH. I HATE YOU. Turns out, he was pulling the strings behind the scenes for ruining Adelaide's reputation. You see, if everyone else is focused on the big bad, who would pay attention to him slowly taking up power? Remember Alex? Judas blackmailed him to do all that shit. Has been feeding Cole and the Canaries false information to throw them off the track. Matteo however, caught him in a lie, revealing him to be the *only* person who could've swapped out Adelaide's meds for sugar pills. Seems like Matteo falling for Adelaide was a bigger wrench in your plans than you thought, huh Judas?
#### Cole and the Canaries
> **Cole** is the leader of *the Canaries*, the disciplinary club of the school. When one of his teachers assigned **Adelaide** to a group project with him and his friends, he took up the opportunity as a chance to "re-educate" her. However, on spending time with her, he realized that she was quite sweet, and any violence she had caused was severely provoked. He and his friends, while not publicly being friends with her, decide to launch a private investigation behind the scenes on why the school treated her so badly.
### Notes
>  I know they're in a school like setting, but the ages are a bit complicated. At some point, **Adelaide** says she's 19, and **Matteo** says he's 21. Only makes sense that they're in college? But why would they be in a behavior school setting then? Why did everyone resemble people I know from Catholic School? What's the meaning of life? Who ate my cheese fries?
>  
>  I know  that I write **Adelaide** as the dumbest person in the room, but she's actually quite smart. Just not socially aware at all. Book smarts? Out the wazoo. Street smarts? Who needs smarts when you have a mean grimace and two fists? Interpersonal relationships? She was never taught how to navigate those, but is trying her best. I think that she was in whatever system that has funneled her in to this school from birth. Like, preemptively had some issues as a child and never got the correct treatment. A few kind souls here and there, but they were also fooled by the system. Could this be a convoluted attempt at a critique of capitalism? My story always end up that way.
