### Beginning
<details><summary>Village Arc</summary>
It all starts in the village at the edge of a large empire. The empire consists of thousands of medium to small islands, each with their own distinct magical abilities.
<br>We are in the body of a young man. While unexpecting on the outside, he holds within him a big secret. He is one of the last Oracles to ever exist. His younger sister, back home at the capital, is the only other one. When they were younger, the youngest was cursed to experience his ailments on a smaller scale. And while you can treat him from afar through his sister, the two do not wish to be life bound anymore. Earlier in the year, we had received a prophetic dream that the small village we are now in was important.
Finding the cure is not the only goal here in this village. You see, we work in a secret three person organization. Along with the Second Crown Prince and the Royal Mage. The three of us had received word that there was unrest in the village. So the SCP sent his most trustworthy knight, with the promise of taking care of his sister, there to spy.
We join the knight at the tail end of a meeting with the SCP and the RM. The SCP had already returned to his duties, but the RM and the OK are still speaking. Speaking puts it lightly, having a relationship spat is more like it. The RM is no Oracle, but they have one of the best intuitions on the planet. And his instincts are going haywire with their partner practically on the other side of the kingdom. In a place he's never been too, so he can't teleport when something goes wrong. And his trying to tell the OK that he needs to get out of there. Stat.
But our poor OK is very stubborn. And he has two missions here, and he's going to complete them. And we're a damn oracle, and our dreams told us to be here. We'll be fine. But of course, his dear RM is, as usual, right. And a few minutes after ending communications, the village is attacked. Attacked by a mysterious demon army. With hellhounds. Many, many hellhounds. The OK barely manages to make it out alive. And he's still being followed by a few of the demonic hounds. He has enough time to send out an "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message, before he has to cut communications out of fear of being tracked by the more, logical, creatures.
