1. In this world,  magical creatures live in groups called covens. Prone to war, each coven has a coalition of guards called "protectors" that are the first line of defense against any  enemy attacks. This story focuses on a coven of outcasts, consisting of 6 core members, 3 adolescents and 3 protectors.
2. The core members consist of a necromancer, an animal witch, an all-seeing sphinx, a harpy, a Xana (siren, spain) , an Echidna (snake woman, greek) and a **...** The protectors are a Phoenix, a Hippogriff and a Ki-Rin. The three children are were-beast siblings. The younger sister being 8 and mouthy, the older sister being 12 and deaf, and the older brother being 16 and emo. This story focus is between the love story between the Phoenix and the Necromancer. And the heartbreak of the Animal Witch.
3. This coven is currently attending a Solstice Party, navigating interpersonal drama and the talks of war. While this coven is viewed as unimportant, they were invited as an example to other dissenting covens of what might happen to them if the oppose those who were more powerful.
4. This all comes to ahead on the fourth day. A game tournament of dodge ball soccer is held between the Protectors of varying covens. The rules of the game is to score as many points as possible. Both the opposing teams nets and coven members give points for being hit. Adolescents are off limits.
5. Instead of networking, this coven decided to sit together to tell stories and play games. It eventually turns into an impromptu fashion show with the Harpy's magic trunk. While not participating, the Necromancer made sure to compliment everyone and clap excitedly when they found outfits they liked. Even the Protectors participated, caving to the jovial nature of the coven.
6. Eventually, this coven's protectors are challenged to a game of dodge ball soccer. Due to it being by a much more powerful coven, they could not refuse. The say their goodbyes and leave. The chatting between the coven continues. At one point, the necromancer notices that the children are getting into a dispute with the coven that challenged hers, and started to get up to go rescue them. 
7. This coven is the only one to announce that they will not be participating in the upcoming war.
8. Our coven's guards are forced into a 8 v 3 by a more powerful coven to embarrass us. While the guards kick ass, the rest of the coven chats leisurely amongst themselves.

```md unfold file:calamity-god-highschool
The FL is a Calamity/Death god
FL has 14 siblings and her parents ascended back into the heavens
Mentally and physically abused at home
Is introverted and has anger issues. FL also has godlike speed, power, and strength. None of these things mix well.
Has so many bad run-ins at the behavioral school FL goes to that she’s known as the school’s “mad dog” because she has put many many kids in the hospital.
When FL is in a good mood, she’s quite kind and thoughtful, but people always try to fight her when she’s in these moods so they don’t last long.
Has two (?) friends. One 2FL is terrified of her and doesn’t want to be around her at all.
The ML is a great friend of hers, and the only one who can calm FL down. FL doesn’t like fighting and no one tends to start them around the ML, so she sticks around him. They hang out a lot after school because FL doesn’t like going home. The ML knows there’s a lot more to the FL than the “mad dog” persona that was forced on her by the school and he’s trying to help her find it.
Skips classes all the time except the Animal Care Club that occurs during the school day. The club is run by two teachers who the FL likes, and two other students attend. She doesn’t interact with one of the students, but the other girl gets on her nerves. The 2FL is a huge fucking bitch to FL.
In the Animal Care Club, she’s made friends with a blue Guneia Chicken, and they can’t be separated. She would kill for him. His name is Henry. She spends most of the school day wandering around the halls with him, waiting for her best friend to get out of class so she can hang out with him.
The school put the FL in charge of a KPOP concert that’s going to happen at the school, and she doesn’t want to do it. She doesn’t even listen to KPOP for fucks sake! The other students don’t want her to do it and made it very apparent that she’ll “just fuck everything up”. However, the other students’ insistence that she’d ruin everything makes her want to do things perfectly. She’s enlisted the help of the ML AND the chicken to help her. (I DONT KNOW WHERE THIS STORYLINE CAME FROM, IT’S JUST WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE DREAM)  
In conclusion: The FL is basically a scared little kid (she’s in high school lmao but in god years) who has a horrible home life and a horrible school life. And she’s been backed into so many corners she’s lashing out at everyone, and everyone tries to push her more and more into the corner. When no one is bothering her, she’s sweet and kind, but the only people who get to see that are her Animal Care teachers and her best friend.

```md unfold file:angels-and-demons-i-guess
Premise: A demon, a goth paladin, and an angel save the world together. The demon and angel get along. The demon and paladin have a lot of sexual tension that they get out with arguing.
Basic Story: The demon is now the head of the Holy Army, and not many people are happy about it. She must do a ritual at a certain spot, or all of the plains will be destroyed. She and a small group of knights, including the royal paladin and her partnered angel arrive in the location by bus. The angel (who happens to be Min Yoongi), runs into his partners, so he hangs back a little to say goodbye to them (just in case). The rest of the group heads to the location, and sets up shop, preparing for the ritual. The demon and paladin are arguing the entire time. However, the end of the world event starts sooner than predicted, so the demon puts in more magical power than predicted into sealing the cataclysm, and collapses. The army members refuse to open a path for the angel to get to them and heal her, because of the prejudice against demons. The paladin, whom the army expected to be on their side, gets extremely pissed off and orders them to move, reminding them that he’s the second in command, and when the demon is out of commission, his word is the law. They move, and the angel commits a taboo of healing a demon and is cast out of heaven. When the demon comes too, she’s pissed at god, so she and the paladin go up (helicopter) to heaven, and the demon breaks in and demands that god reinstates the angel. After a day of arguing, god agrees, but only if the demon has a sparring match with her. It turns out, that god is a sub lesbian that just wants to be pinned down sometimes. The demon wins, the angel gets a promotion to Archangel (let's go Yoongi), and the Paladin lets go of his prejudices, and they’re all friends in the end.
