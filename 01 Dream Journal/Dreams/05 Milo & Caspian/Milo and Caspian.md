								<div class="callout-title-inner">  The Odysseus Arc</div>
							</div>
								<p>Our story starts out when <b><b>Milo</b></b> runs away from home and joins the ship <i><i>The Odysseus</i></i>. The large ship is a cruise ship, and needs new engineers to help down below. <b>Milo</b> and the rest of the new crew mates are introduced to the only repeat engineer, <b>Caspian</b>. <b>Caspian</b> has a history of being… well… a monster to deal with. He's bad at team playing, always going ahead to work on problems without consulting the others. And refusing to let the others help him. The only reason he hasn't been fired is because he's an extremely talented engineer. </p>
								<p> Because of spacing issues, <b>Milo</b> is assigned to be <b>Caspian</b>'s roommate. Who seems to actually not mind the wet-behind-the-ears newcomers company. After spending a couple of months out on the sea, <b>Milo</b> falls ill with the flu that's been rampaging around the ship. And <b>Caspian</b> actually doesn't ignore his poor sick roommate, he sticks around to help take care of him and keep him company. This cements their blossoming friendship. </p>
								<p> <b>Caspian</b> takes it upon himself to teach <b>Milo</b> how to run the engines, telling him to forget everything that he learned from the others. Apparently, what <b>Milo</b> was taught to do was purposely wired to break periodically, so the other engineers could come in and take over his posts, as well as the money he was being paid. This explains why <b>Caspian</b> is so secretive about how he fixes his engines, which seem to never have any faults. As <b>Caspian</b> teaches <b>Milo</b>, they spend a lot of time down in the bottom of the ship… all alone… not another soul within listening distance… </p>
								<p> Halfway through the voyage, <i>The Odysseus</i> docks at a port in a place that looked like France. With it, came along a fresh batch of engineers. And these guys were pieces of work. They were extremely braggadocious, and rude as well. Never taking no for an answer, they continuously tried to force <b>Caspian</b> into revealing his secret engineering techniques. Who seemed way to chill about the whole thing. <b>Milo</b>, fed up with everything, got in fights on his behalf, even though <b>Caspian</b> repeatedly told him it wasn’t worth. <b>Milo</b> wasn't having it, who would let their lover be talked about like that? </p>
								<p> As <i>The Odysseus</i> continued its voyage, their seemed to be more and more issues with the other workers engines. Perhaps the French assholes weren't as good as they bragged they were? It doesn't matter, because they were looking for a scape goat to pin their mistakes on. They decided to blame <b>Caspian</b> and <b>Milo</b> of sabotaging them. And since <b>Milo</b> and <b>Caspian</b> spent most of their time alone with engines, the other engineers started to believe them. Of course, a bit of colorism, ableism, and homophobia also buoyed the dicks argument. </p>
								<p> This is where <b>Caspian</b>'s background started to unravel. The thing about <b>Caspian</b> is, he never told a lie. So when the engineers dragged the two lovers out of their room and accused the two of breaking into the engine rooms at night, <b>Caspian</b> told the truth: He didn't break into the engine rooms, he had the key to the door which was given to him by the late Captain of <i>The Star Gazer</i>. Which was the base of which this ship was built of off. </p>
								<p>Now, everyone found this suspicious, because the <b>Captain</b> of <i>The Star Gazer</i> had died over 150 years ago. <b>Milo</b>, confused by this confession, continued to support his lover, arguing into the night, and physically getting involved when they tried to rip the key out of <b>Caspian</b>'s grasp. And for the first time, <b>Caspian</b> raised his voice in anger. With the a loud booming voice, he finally invoked his role as the head engineer and ordered everyone to return back to their rooms, and that the conversation would continue when they leave port in the morning. However, in the morning, <b>Caspian</b> and <b>Milo</b> were nowhere to be found. And <i>The Odysseus</i> was left in the hands of those bastard Frenchmen.</p>

								<div class="callout-title-inner">  Sea of Monsters</div>
							</div>
								<p> As the crew search for the two deserters, <b>Caspian</b> and <b>Milo</b> are on a small ship heading towards the <b>Sea of Monsters</b>. <b>Milo</b> is rightfully freaked out about this, but <b>Caspian</b> comforts and assures him that he'll explain everything soon. <b>Milo</b> thinks to himself, "If I'm being taken to my death by monster, I'm slightly more ok with it if I'm dying next to this idiot beside me". As they travel, the sea is suspiciously calm, and they quickly come across the reason why. An unnatural whirlpool has formed, and <b>Caspian</b> seems determined to drive right into it, even as <b>Milo</b> is panicking.</p>
								 <p><q>Hey Cas… Cas? Love?... CAS!! DO YOU HAPPEN TO NOT SEE THE GIANT FUCKING WHIRLPOOL YOU'RE DRIVING US IN TO???</q>
								<br><q> Calm down baby, don't you trust me?</q> 
								<br><q>I'M SERIOUSLY RECONSIDERING THAT RIGHT NOW.</q></p>
								<p> The two get sucked into the whirlpool, and <b>Milo</b> quickly comes to terms with his death. However, he seems to not be drowning? Or wet? At all? He still keeps his eyes firmly shut, as if to not wake up from a dream, as he feels the hull of his boat gently hit the ocean floor. Soft hands take his, and <b>Caspian</b>'s voice, shakier then normal, and slightly distorted, quietly asks him to open his eyes.</p>
								<p> When <b>Milo</b> slowly opens his eyes, he immediately starts having a panic attack because, what the fuck. Why is he at the bottom of the ocean? Why can he breathe? Why can he see clearly? What the fuck is thing in front of him impersonating his partner? Is he dead? Is this heaven? <b>Caspian</b>, seeing that <b>Milo</b> is panicking, and quickly tries to calm him down, using the tricks that <b>Milo</b> had told him that worked. And with that, <b>Milo</b>, realizes that the creature in front of him is in fact <b>Caspian</b>. And that <b>Caspian</b> was a merman (?) this entire time. </p>

							<p>The <i>Star Gazer</i>  was an aircraft of legends. The voyager was commanded by the legendary <b>Captain Nyarai Laforeze </b>and her trusty first mate, <b>Cadenza Milore</b>. The ship was massive, nearing 1000 ft long. And the size of the crew was nothing to sneeze at. Hundreds of crew members were on that ship, but to the general public, only about 20 were named. The <i>Star Gazer</i> braved many a storm, monsters, and foes alike. But, nothing could ever destroy her. The stories of her adventures reached every corner of the globe. However, one day, <i>The Star Gazer</i> mysteriously went down over the <b>Sea of Monsters</b>, and vanished from the known world. No wreckage or survivors were reportedly ever found.</p>
