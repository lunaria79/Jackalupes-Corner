						Three kids end up running into the woods to avoid the police, and fall in love while doing so. They are wanted for reasons I dont remember. And they're thriving in the woods. Though they all follow a certain "archetype", they are all incredibly intelligent. The nerd is just more so. Turns out, this dream was me reading a biography, and they stayed together for the rest of their lives.

						While the nerd is sleeping somewhat soundly, the jock decides that it's time to confess to the theater kid. While talking quietly, as not to wake up the nerd, the two talk about how they all met and ended up running away together. The jock reveals that earlier in the night, he head confessed his feelings to the nerd, finally picking up on the hints that she had been dropping. And he says to the theater kid that he knows that there's tension between the three of them, and that he wanted confess to the theater kid as well. He doesn't even get to continue, as the theater kid tackles him to the ground with a hug. The nerd, who was half awake most of the time, crawls over and gives them both kisses on the head. No more words are spoken that night.
