							<h4> The Lost Years </h4>
							<p> He knew about the anger, but he did not expect it to come so fast. And it scared him deeply. He would awake from a sea of black to a destroyed home. Furnitures thrown about. His pots and utensils shattered across the floor. Blood caking deep gouges in his cave's wall. All the stress, the confusion, and the hurt had condensed down into something sinister. And he started to dread what might happen if he saw her again. </p> 
							<p> Next came the hair. It took him a while to notice. As he assumed that it was just in the nature of growing up. But his arms grew hairier, as well as his legs, back and chest. Thicker during the winters, thinning out in the spring and the summers. He figured there were more important things to be worrying about. </p> 
							<p> He found that he could run faster and for longer. His arms grew thick with muscle. His vision increased dramatically. Could hear farther, see farther, smell farther. He grew rapidly in size. He was able to Safely hunt larger and larger prey. Gone were the days of feasting on rabbits. </p> 
							<p> One stormy day, he noticed a trail. Old, yet familiar. He followed it eagerly, hoping that it would lead to her. What he found instead tore his heart asunder with grief. Bones. Old. And rotting. Any flush had been picked clean. With the bracelet that he made her. Broken and scattered across the ground. Aspen too died there that day. As he howled in sadness his body changed. Bones breaking, changing. His flesh contorting and expanding. The fur erupting from his body a dire wolf stood where he once was. Gathering what it could in its giant maw, it fled deeper into the heart of the woods. </p>
