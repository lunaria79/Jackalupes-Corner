								<p>The story begins in a village at the edge of a vast empire composed of thousands of medium to small islands, each with unique magical abilities.</p>
								<p>We find ourselves in the body of a young man, <b>Xenos</b>, who, despite his unassuming exterior, harbors a significant secret. He, and his twin sister, <b>Levana</b>, are the last two remaining <i>Oracles</i> in the isles. While he labors as the Captain of the Guards, his sister remains bedridden due to her visions ruining her body.</p>
								<p><b>Xenos</b> have been sent to the village of <i>Maoria</i> to find credible evidence against the corrupt mayor colluding with <b>Damaeth</b>. We enter <b>Xeno’s</b> body as he ends a remote meeting between <b>Amore</b>, the second prince, and <b>Ithe</b>, the royal mage. <b>Amore</b> had left for his duties earlier, but <b>Xenos</b> and <b>Ithe</b> were still speaking—more accurately, having a relationship spat.</p>
								<p>While <b>Ithe’s</b> powers of intuition aren’t as strong or as accurate as <b>Levana’s</b> or <b>Xenos</b>, his instincts are next to none. His gut has been churning since sunset, and he's afraid of his partner being on the other side of the kingdom alone in a place he cannot get to. <b>Xenos</b> is too stubborn to listen to <b>Ithe's</b> pleads for him to leave, and it has caused a massive argument.</p>
								<p>Of course, <b>Ithe</b>, as usual, right. Minutes after ending communication, the village is attacked by a mysterious demon army with an unending hoard of hellhounds. <b>Xenos</b> barely manages to escape with his life, sending out a distress call right before he shut down communications in order not to be magiaclly traced.</p>

								<p><b>Xeno</b> escapes on foot, all other forms of transportation either killed or destroyed. Admist the dark auras of hellhounds, <b>Xeno</b> senses something amiss. He soon realizes that he is being followed by a seperate entity as well.</p>
								<p>While hurriedly trying to make a boat, a headless dog bursts into the clearing. <b>Xeno's</b> discovers the true purpose of the town.  <b>Damaeth</b> was attempting to create an army of unkillable creatures. This headless dog is the only living survivor. Sensing no ill will, we let it climb into our boat and cross the water.</p>
								<p><b>Xenos</b> arrives back in the capital through less-than-legal means. Concerned about the dog's headless nature, <b>Xenos</b> crafts it a head, and with a little magic and a blue handkerchief, it becomes a completely normal Pyrenees dog.</p>
								<p>On the way to the castle through the catacombs, the <b>Damaeth's</b> men stop us, attempting to arrest us under the pretense of causing the village's destruction. In a massive stroke of luck, we are summoned to <b>Levana's</b> chambers by a very upset <b>Ithe</b>.</p>

								<p>After a tearful reunion, the conversation quickly shifts to that of the fate of <i>Maoria</i>. <b>Levana</b> had dreamed of the end of the kingdom, starting with <i>Maoria's</i> destruction by the hands of demons. </p>
								<p> A few days later, <b>Xenos</b> awakes with the worst brain fog and nausea he's ever experienced. The only thought in his mind is that he needs to get to the warf as quickly as possible. He stumbles through the city, just before dawn. Upon reaching the end of an dock, <b>Xenos</b> falls to his knees, experiencing the most powerful vision he had ever received. It is so powerful, that vision is shared with <b>Levana</b>, as to not destroy either twin's mind.They see the capital's destruction and burning, with demon ships barely over the horizon. They have less than half a day to evacuate the city.</p>
								<p>As <b>Levana</b> rushes to inform <b>Amore</b> and <b>Ithe</b>, <b>Xenos</b> flags down two soldiers to send a letter to his loved ones as he perpares himself to die alone to portect his family.</p>

							<p>A less than serious young man, with a big heart. While known as the "people's prince", he does not believe that he is suited for the throne. He only fights for the crown due to his older brother's less than stellar treatment of those who were not nobles. </p>

							 <p><i>Ithe</i> grew up alongside the rest of our motley crew, constantly being dragged into schemes "against" his will. Due to his solemn nature and smooth talking abilities, he navigated the boys ways out of many lashings.</p>
							 <p>As adults, he and the <b>Levana</b> are the most serious about their jobs, and it is a constant source of conflict with <b>Xenos</b>, due to him still wanting to goof off on the job.</p>

							 <p>Due to her visions impacting her more physically than her brother, <b>Levana</b> has always been a very sickly person. Due to this, the former king had her confined to her bed chambers where she could be well enough to be of use.

							<p>I stand before you today, not from the comfort of our castle and home, but from the stark reality of our situation. This morning, a devastating prophecy reached both <b>Levana</b> and me, foretelling the destruction of our beloved kingdom. I know you must be wondering why I am here, at the docks, far from the castle walls. Let me explain.</p>
							<p>I woke up this morning with the most excruciating pain in my head, a migraine that clouded my thoughts and tormented my senses. But amidst the agony, a powerful urge pulled me here, to the docks. I may have frightened some of our citizens with my unsteady gait, but what I discovered was far more terrifying than any of my actions.</p>
							<p>As soon as my feet touched the wooden planks, a flood of visions assaulted my mind. The demons, our ancient enemies, are gathering just beyond the horizon. Their army has grown, bolstered by the souls of our fallen, now twisted into thralls. Their hellhounds are more numerous than ever before. This is not a battle we can win. I beg of you, evacuate the kingdom. Save our people and our soldiers from a fate worse than death.</p>
							<p>This decision to stay might shock you, but it is one I have made with a clear mind and a heavy heart. My duty to protect this kingdom is unwavering, and I will fight to my last breath.</p>
							<p><b>Amore</b>, my dearest friend, since we were children, I knew you were destined for greatness, far surpassing that tyrant of a brother. Growing up with you has been one of the greatest joys of my life. From our spirited horse races to our fierce hunting competitions, and even in love, I have cherished every moment of besting you. But truly, you have been the brother I never had, and for that, I love you dearly. Do not mourn me, for I will haunt the kitchens, pilfering food just like old times.</p>
							<p><b>Levana</b>, my precious baby sister, my heart aches for the pain I have caused you, both physical and emotional. I am deeply sorry that I could not lift the curse that plagues you. I have not said it enough, but I love you with all my heart. Since our parents' passing, it has been you and me against the world, and I wouldn't trade that for anything. Forget my harsh words during our youth; I lashed out at the wrong person. As the last living oracle, may your future prophecies bring joy and light to the world.</p>
							<p><b>Ithe</b>, my love, I know you must be furious with me, and rightly so. I made this decision without you, and I am sorry for the pain it causes. Our last conversations were marred by my stubbornness, and I regret every argument. I know I have shattered our dreams for the future, and for that, I am deeply sorry. You deserved better than a foolish lover like me. Know that I love you to the moons and back, and I will speak your name with my dying breath.</p>
							<p>This is not the end, my dear ones. Though I stay behind, my love and spirit will always be with you. Save our people, live on, and remember me not with sorrow, but with the joy of our shared memories. Farewell.</p>

							<p>The sun shone brightly on the gardens below, a stark contrast to the storm brewing within my heart. As the <i>Royal Mage</i>, I couldn't afford to show any signs of distress. The words we exchanged still echoed in my mind, a bitter reminder of my failed attempts to keep him safe. I told him to leave the dangerous situation, but he dug his heels in like a stuborn ass. </p>
							<p>From the tower, I watched the tea gathering, trying to focus on my duties and keep my mind off the worry gnawing at me. My heart sank to my feet as I saw <b>Amore</b>, a grim look etched on his face, rush to <b>Levana's</b> side, dashing all hope from my mind. They had a quick, urgent conversation before both started heading towards my tower, ignoring all inquires from passerbys.</p>
							<p>My heart raced as I checked the comms. The message flashed before my eyes: "Mayday. Mayday. The town defenses have been breached by--" Then, "connection lost."</p>
							<p>A whirlwind of emotions surged through me. Vindication mingled with panic and anger. I was right all along. But where was he? Where the fuck was my partner? The urge to burn down a small, unnecessary building flared up, but logic had to prevail. Taking a deep breath, I steeled myself. We're finding this mule, and when we do, I'll smack the idoacity out of him.</p>
							<p>Turning on my heel, I approached the pounding on my door. We needed a plan. He was out there somewhere, and I would not rest until we brought him back safely. And when we did, heavens help me, he would never ignore my warnings again.</p>
