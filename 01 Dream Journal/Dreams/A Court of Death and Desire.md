			<p> Upon arriving at the event, our fae queen learns that there has been a string of murders that occurred She, and a few others, happen to witness one of them where the Captain of the Court of <b>???</b>  had his arms removed.</p>
			<p>Her and the rest of the witnesses, are quickly shuttled off into their respective rooms, under the assumption that one of them is the murderer, or the others will be soon be murdered. Fortunately, while all of the witnesses were present at a meeting with the high council, another fae was murdered, meaning they were somewhat cleared of suspicion.</p>
			<p>During the meeting with the high council, it was revealed that the user of the rare <b>Death Ruin</b> magic.  Our fae queen ruling <b> A Court of Death and Desire </b> automatically puts her in suspicion.  It is then revealed, that one of the witnesses has the rare <b>Savior's Grace</b>, which is the only magic able to combat <b>Dark Ruin</b>.  However, our fae queen had witnessed the supposed "user" displaying high aptitude in grass magic, tripping fae for fun on the front lawns. While suspicious of her and her <b>handler</b>, our fae queens keeps that suspicion to herself, and returns to her quarters. And bars entry to everyone but the captain of the royal guard. </p>

				<div class="callout-title-inner"> Side Story</div>
			</div>
			<p>Our fae queen is well, a queen, meaning that she is awarded more privileges than the other suspects. Instead of investigating the murder, like another story may have done, she instead chooses to tend to her gardens and stables. Which are barriered off from all other fae, even the high fae.</p>
			<p>While the rest of the gala is concerned about murders and engaging in espionage, our fae queen is riding her horses, tending her flowers and avoiding her <b>ex-betrothed</b>. She wears her iridescent battle armor to avoid being recognized. One day, while she's out and about, she comes across the corpse of one of the horses owned by the host of the gala, with a newborn horse sitting next to it, malnourished.  She quickly rides up to the stables and captures the attention of the sole <b>stable hand</b>. She was surprised by his grieving reaction and quickly grew a liking to him. </p>
			<p>However, it is later discovered that her <b>ex-betrothed</b> had murdered the horse to get her attention, knowing that she rides out that way. He waits for her outside of her garden, absolutely pissed that he can no longer enter.</p>
			<p>I don't fully recall what happens, but in the end she slaps that nigga across the face.</p>
