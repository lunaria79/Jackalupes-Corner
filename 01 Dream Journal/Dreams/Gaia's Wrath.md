			<p>Two girls are suddenly captured by a portal, and are transported to a tropical island full of strange Pokémon. As they walk through the forest, unafraid, many Pokémon approached them in curiosity. Eventually, a Pokémon that look similar to a bear cub stained yellow, approached them with a gleam of higher intelligence in his eye. It leads them to a group of 5 Guys, who in turn lead them to the scientist that is the defacto leader of the island. The scientist, being there the longest (since the 1600s), has gone crazy, but is loving it. Spends most of her days talking to her plants and doing experiments. However, Gaia doesn't see her fit to be a leader, and tries to take charge. Janet stands awkwardly behind everyone.</p>

			<p>While <b>Gaia</b> and <b>the scientist</b> were talking, <b>Sun</b> lead <b>Janet</b> to a crystal hatch that had mysteriously opened. Upon leading her to <b>Moon</b>, the two cubs initiated a soul contract with <b>Janet</b>, and they were so cute she had to accept.  After the contract is finished, she exits the hatch and immediately runs in to <b>the scientist</b>. <b>The scientist</b> explains how never could figure out how to open the hatch, and gave up trying when starting to focus on survival. When arriving back at <b>the scientists</b> home, Gaia is consumed by jealousy, as she had been wanting to keep <b>Sun</b> as a pet. She was trying to convince one of the <b>Five Guys</b> to give her one of their few pokéballs. As <b>Gaia</b> watches the three interact, she grows angrier and angrier, and plants start to grow out of her body, beautiful and deadly.</p>

			<p>Janet is significantly less popular than <b>Gaia</b>, and kept to her self. She loves <b>Gaia</b>, but entering school has seriously changed her from the kind and loving child she once knew. The island didn't affect her mind like <b>Gaia</b> and <b>the scientist</b>,  as it had chosen her as it's <b>deity [subject to change] </b>.</p>
