							<p>Two girls are suddenly captured by a portal, and are transported to a tropical island full of strange Pokémon. As they walk through the forest, unafraid, many Pokémon approached them in curiosity. Eventually, a Pokémon that look similar to a bear cub stained yellow, approached them with a gleam of higher intelligence in his eye. It leads them to a group of <b>5 Guys</b>, who in turn lead them to the scientist that is the defacto leader of the island. <b>The scientist</b>, being there the longest (since the 1600s), has gone crazy, but is loving it. Spends most of her days talking to her plants and doing experiments. However, <b>Gaia</b> doesn't see her fit to be a leader, and tries to take charge. <b>Janet</b> stands awkwardly behind everyone.</p>

							<p>Fed up with her attitude, <b>Janet</b> rightfully points out <b>Gaia's</b> selfishness, which causes the young women to detonate. How dare <b>Janet</b> speak to her in that way? As she erupts in anger, <b>Gaia</b> attacks <b>Janet</b>, trying to steal her bears.</p>

							<p>While <b>Gaia</b> and <b>the scientist</b> were talking, <b>Sun</b> lead <b>Janet</b> to a crystal hatch that had mysteriously opened. Upon leading her to <b>Moon</b>, the two cubs initiated a soul contract with <b>Janet</b>, and they were so cute she had to accept.  After the contract is finished, she exits the hatch and immediately runs in to <b>the scientist</b>. <b>The scientist</b> explains how never could figure out how to open the hatch, and gave up trying when starting to focus on survival. When arriving back at <b>the scientists</b> home, Gaia is consumed by jealousy, as she had been wanting to keep <b>Sun</b> as a pet. She was trying to convince one of the <b>Five Guys</b> to give her one of their few pokéballs. As <b>Gaia</b> watches the three interact, she grows angrier and angrier, and plants start to grow out of her body, beautiful and deadly.</p>
