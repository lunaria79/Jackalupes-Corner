								<p>It all starts in the village at the edge of a large empire. The empire consists of thousands of medium to small islands, each with their own distinct magical abilities.</p>
								<p>We are in the body of a young man. While unexpecting on the outside, he holds within him a big secret. He is one of the last Oracles to ever exist. His younger sister, back home at the capital, is the only other one. When they were younger, the youngest was cursed to experience his ailments on a smaller scale. And while you can treat him from afar through his sister, the two do not wish to be life bound anymore. Earlier in the year, we had received a prophetic dream that the small village we are now in was important.</p>
								<p>Finding the cure is not the only goal here in this village. You see, we work in a secret three person organization. Along with the Second Crown Prince and the Royal Mage. The three of us had received word that there was unrest in the village. So the SCP sent his most trustworthy knight, with the promise of taking care of his sister, there to spy.</p>
								<p>We join the knight at the tail end of a meeting with the SCP and the RM. The SCP had already returned to his duties, but the RM and the OK are still speaking. Speaking puts it lightly, having a relationship spat is more like it. The RM is no Oracle, but they have one of the best intuitions on the planet. And his instincts are going haywire with their partner practically on the other side of the kingdom. In a place he's never been too, so he can't teleport when something goes wrong. And his trying to tell the OK that he needs to get out of there. Stat.</p>
								<p>But our poor OK is very stubborn. And he has two missions here, and he's going to complete them. And we're a damn oracle, and our dreams told us to be here. We'll be fine. But of course, his dear RM is, as usual, right. And a few minutes after ending communications, the village is attacked. Attacked by a mysterious demon army. With hellhounds. Many, many hellhounds. The OK barely manages to make it out alive. And he's still being followed by a few of the demonic hounds. He has enough time to send out an "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message, before he has to cut communications out of fear of being tracked by the more, logical, creatures.</p>

								<p> The CP was there, cause he had known that I had been sent to investigate the village. And was also concerned when the village was destroyed. He himself knew that it wasn't me. So barged into our going to be reunion with discussions of politics. He's kind of a dick. </p>
								<p> It turns out, at the start of the empire, the original oracle predicted the destruction of the kingdom as we know it to be done by demons. And it'll start with the dogs. Which was very concerning, so it became a royal secret passed down through first crown princes. Imagine how upset everyone else in the room was when they found this out. A lot of arguing happened and nothing got done. </p>
								<p> But more importantly, or loyal doggo betrayed us. He instantly took a liking to our sister. And she was as equally taken by him. She didn't even care that he was headless! So the bitch dog laid there getting belly rubs. We want belly rubs and head scritches too!   </p>
								<p> A few days past, and one day we wake up with the largest bout of brain fog and nausea we've ever experienced. And we only knew one thing. "I got to get the docks".  So our clearly horrendously sick self managed to get down through the city to the docks. And upon arrival, we have the most powerful vision we've ever received. So powerful the vision gets shared between our sister, so to not kill us. We see the destruction and burning of the capital. And we see that the demon ships are but barely over the horizon. We have less than half a day. </p>
								<p> While our sister is up at the castle, working through her half of the sickness, while informing everyone, we start our way back up to the castle. However, half way, our mind clears a little, and we make a decision. We’re staying. And only us.   </p>
								<p> We manage to flag down two soldiers that can read and write, and send up a letter to our loved ones. And we return the docks, sword and armor on hand. And we wait. </p>

							<p>So now we're on the run on foot. Any other form of transportation was either killed or destroyed. Fun fact about hellhounds, they have 4 legs and are very fast. We may be very fast, but we only have two legs. So the chase is long and harrowing. Not long after the beginning, we realize there something else with four legs following us. But it doesn't have the same demonic energy as the other beasts following us. And while we lose the hellhounds somehow, this animal is still making a beeline for us.</p>
							<p>While we're hurriedly trying to make a boat. A headless dog bursts into the clearing. And we discover what the real purpose of that town was. The CP was attempting to create an army of unkillable creatures. And started experiments with small rodents. And had worked his way up to dogs. This pupper was the only success. Sensing no ill will coming from it, we allow it to climb up in our backpack, and we make haste across the water.</p>
							<p>We arrive back in the capital, through not exactly legal means. Concerned about the headless nature of our new dog, we craft him a head, and with a little magic and a blue handkerchief, we have a totally completely normal Pyrenees dog.</p>
							<p>On the way back up to the castle through the catacombs, we are stopped by the CP's men. Who attempt to arrest us under the pretense of us being the cause of the destruction of the village. And also tried to take our dog. Which is honestly bullshit and everyone there knew it. Lucky for us, we were then teleported into the RM's chamber, where the aforementioned mage, the TWO CP's and our sister were waiting.</p>
