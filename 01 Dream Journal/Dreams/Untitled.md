							</div>
							<p> <b>Adelaide</b> starts making friends in her classroom, when she was forced into a group project. <b>Cole</b> and the others seemed a bit uppity, but weren't rude so she liked them. She won them over with her hard work and treats she brought from home. </p>
							<p> But for some fucking reason, her classmate <b> Alex </b> inserts himself in the group, demands she give him some of the noodles she had made, and when she didn't have any desert left to give him, broke into her backpack and stole some of her strawberry ice cream. She grabs him by the shirt, almost punches the daylights out of him, takes a deep breath, and then asks calmly (for her) why the hell he was behaving this way. </p>
							<p> Presumably because he thought she had gone soft, Alex proceeds to attack the surrounding disciplinary students that were trying to intervene. Seeing <b> Alex </b> attack her new friends, <b> Adelaide </b> sees red and body slams him through a table. At this point the bell rings and <b> Alex </b> escapes into the fray. </p>

								<div class="callout-title-inner"> Bus #69 </div>
							</div>
							<p> <b> Adelaide</b> was reassigned to a new bus (Bus #69) which turns out to be the same bus where all the pathetic misplaced nerds go. While never meeting her, all of the nerds are terrified of her due to her reputation. An honestly really cute black girl named <b> Janet</b> was elected to try and stop her when she got on, but <b> Adelaide</b> says "It's kind of you to try and hug me, but we don't know each other well enough for that. " (Our <b> Adelaide</b> is kind of dumb.) </p>
							<p><b> Adelaide </b> selects her seat towards the middle of the bus, which is later taken up by a strange tall blonde man, with a gleam in his eye. Reveals himself as <b> Matteo </b>, and starts asking strange questions, like "What do you like to do outside of school?" and "What do you think about these outfit ideas?". His friend named <b>Judas</b> regularly chimes in with a joke or anecdote. <b> Adelaide </b> is not entirely sure what's happening, but it feels nice so she lets it continue.</p>

							<p>The scariest person at the behavioral school. But she's really sweet if you try to get to know her. She's absolutely massive, like orc build. 6'5, built like a freight train. Long frizzy auburn hair with chiseled features. Likes baking and reading. Wolf autism. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but she's trying really hard. Doesn't understand why people are mean to her. </p>

							<p> on the shorter side, black hair and stubble. unassuming. good friends with **Matteo**. Gets along well with Adelaide.</p>
							<p> FAKE ASS BITCH. I HATE YOU. Turns out, he was pulling the strings behind the scenes for ruining Adelaide's reputation. You see, if everyone else is focused on the big bad, who would pay attention to him slowly taking up power? Remember <b> Alex</b>? Judas blackmailed him to do all that shit. Has been feeding Cole and the Canaries false information to throw them off the track. Matteo however, caught him in a lie, revealing him to be the _only_ person who could've swapped out Adelaide's meds for sugar pills. Seems like Matteo falling for Adelaide was a bigger wrench in your plans than you thought, huh Judas? </p>
