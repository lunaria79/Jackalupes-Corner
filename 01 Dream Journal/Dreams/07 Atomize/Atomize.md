								<p>The story begins in a village at the edge of a vast empire composed of thousands of medium to small islands, each with unique magical abilities.</p>
								<p>We find ourselves in the body of a young man, <b>Xenos</b>, who, despite his unassuming exterior, harbors a significant secret. He, and his twin sister, <b>Levana</b>, are the last two remaining <i>Oracles</i> in the isles. While he labors as the Captain of the Guards, his sister remains bedridden due to her visions ruining her body.</p>
								<p><b>Xenos</b> have been sent to the village of <i>Maoria</i> to find credible evidence against the corrupt mayor colluding with <b>the crown prince</b>. We enter <b>Xeno’s</b> body as he ends a remote meeting between <b>Amore</b>, the second prince, and <b>Ithe</b>, the royal mage. <b>Amore</b> had left for his duties earlier, but <b>Xenos</b> and <b>Ithe</b> were still speaking—more accurately, having a relationship spat.</p>
								<p>While <b>Ithe’s</b> powers of intuition aren’t as strong or as accurate as <b>Levana’s</b> or <b>Xenos</b>, his instincts are next to none. His gut has been churning since sunset, and he's afraid of his partner being on the other side of the kingdom alone in a place he cannot get to. <b>Xenos</b> is too stubborn to listen to <b>Ithe's</b> pleads for him to leave, and it has caused a massive argument.</p>
								<p>Of course, <b>Ithe</b>, as usual, right. Minutes after ending communication, the village is attacked by a mysterious demon army with an unending hoard of hellhounds. <b>Xenos</b> barely manages to escape with his life, sending out a distress call right before he shut down communications in order not to be magiaclly traced.</p>

								<p><b>Xeno</b> escapes on foot, all other forms of transportation either killed or destroyed. Admist the dark auras of hellhounds, <b>Xeno</b> senses something amiss. He soon realizes that he is being followed by a seperate entity as well.</p>
								<p>While hurriedly trying to make a boat, a headless dog bursts into the clearing. We discover the true purpose of the town: the <b>Crown Prince</b> was attempting to create an army of unkillable creatures. This headless dog is the only living survivor. Sensing no ill will, we let it climb into our boat and cross the water.</p>
								<p><b>Xenos</b> arrives back in the capital through less-than-legal means. Concerned about the dog's headless nature, <b>Xenos</b> crafts it a head, and with a little magic and a blue handkerchief, it becomes a completely normal Pyrenees dog.</p>
								<p>On the way to the castle through the catacombs, the <b>Crown Prince's</b> men stop us, attempting to arrest us under the pretense of causing the village's destruction. In a massive stroke of luck, we are summoned to <b>Levana's</b> chambers by a very upset <b>Ithe</b>.</p>

								<div class="callout-title"> <div class="callout-title-inner">  Kill Yourself, Come On Do Us All a Favour  </div> </div>
								<p>After a tearful reunion, the conversation quickly shifts to that of the fate of <i>Maoria</i>. <b>Levana</b> had dreamed of the end of the kingdom, starting with <i>Maoria's</i> destruction by the hands of demons. </p>
								<p> A few days later, <b>Xenos</b> awakes with the worst brain fog and nausea he's ever experienced. The only thought in his mind is that he needs to get to the warf as quickly as possible. He stumbles through the city, just before dawn. Upon reaching the end of an dock, <b>Xenos</b> falls to his knees, experiencing the most powerful vision he had ever received. It is so powerful, that vision is shared with <b>Levana</b>, as to not destroy either twin's mind.They see the capital's destruction and burning, with demon ships barely over the horizon. They have less than half a day to evacuate the city.</p>
								<p>As <b>Levana</b> rushes to inform <b>Amore</b> and <b>Ithe</b>, <b>Xenos</b> flags down two soldiers to send a letter to his loved ones as he perpares himself to die alone to portect his family.</p>

							 <p><b>Xenos</b> is the pride and joy of the capital city. Known as the "people's champion", he rose from the status of street orphan to that of the revered captain of the royal guard.

							<p>A less than serious young man, with a big heart. While known as the ""people's" prince", he does not believe that he is suited for the throne. He only fights for the crown due to his older brother's less than stellar treatment of those who were not nobles. </p>

							 <p><i>Ithe</i> grew up alongside the rest of our motley crew, constantly being dragged into schemes "against" his will. Due to his solemn nature and smooth talking abilities, he navigated the boys ways out of many lashings.</p>
							 <p>As adults, he and the <b>Levana</b> are the most serious about their jobs, and it is a constant source of conflict with <b>Xenos</b>, due to him still wanting to goof off on the job.</p>

							 <p>Due to her visions impacting her more physically than her brother, <b>Levana</b> has always been a very sickly person.

							<p>Hello everyone, you might have noticed that I'm not in the castle. Today, as I'm sure you've heard from REDACTED that we've both received the prophecy of the destruction of the kingdom. But more importantly, I guess I should explain how I got down here. I woke up with the most devastating headache I've ever had. Now that I think about it, it was probably a migraine. I digress. All I knew was that I had to get down to the docks. Now I might have scared some of our citizens with the sluggish way I was walking. But it's a bit too late now. We have more pressing matters at hand. Which I'll get to in a minute.</p>
							<p>When I arrived at the docks, as soon as I set foot on wood planks it's made of, my mind was flung forward. And an influx of information greeted my third eye. The demons are just across the horizon. And their army has grown. Those killed by them are taking up as thralls. There are more hellhounds than ever before. This is not a battle that can be won. I strongly recommend we evacuate everyone, citizens and soldiers alike.</p>
							<p>This may come as a surprise to you, but I've decided to stay. My mind is clearing as these two excellent young fellows are writing. And it's my duty to protect this kingdom to my dying breath. Ergo, I'm staying and you can't convince me otherwise. So I am to write down my last words to you.</p>
							<p><b>REDACTED</b>: You have been one of my closest friends since childhood. And since then, I knew that you would make a much better king than that bitch of a brother. Growing up alongside of you was one of the happiest experiences in my life. From beating you in horse races, to beating to you in hunting competitions to beating you in finding love first, I have loved one upping you in every aspect in life. I jest. You're the closest thing to an older brother I have ever had. And for that I love and adore you. Please do not miss me when I'm gone. I'm going to haunt your ass, so we can continue pilfering the kitchens for the rest of our lives.</p>
							<p><b>REDACTED</b>: My beloved baby sister. I'm sorry for all of the pain I have caused you over the years. Physically and mentally. It seems to the very end I was unable to cure you of that damn curse. And for that, I will apologize for the rest of eternity. I know that I haven't said it enough growing up but I love you. Since the death of our parents, it's been you and me against the world, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Please forget anything mean I said during puberty, I didn't mean any of it. I was lashing out at the wrong person. It's something I'll never forgive myself for. As you continue on to be the last oracle living, I hope the rest of your prophecies be merry.</p>
							<p><b>REDACTED</b>: Hey love. I know you're probably mad at me. And you should be. Making this decision without your input. But I feel like it was important to do. I'm sorry that our last few conversations have been arguments due to my own pig headed behavior.  I'm sorry that I'm throwing a massive wrench in our plans for the future. You didn't ask for such an idiot of a boyfriend did you. I love you too the moons and back, and then some. May I forever last in your memory, as I speak your name as my final breath.</p>

							<p>Imagine you're the RM. And the last conversation you had with your partner was telling him he needs to leave a dangerous situation and he ignored you. And you ended the communications on a sour note. And you're trying to go about your duties, keeping your mind off of worrying about him. Cause, you’re the great Royal Mage! You can't show sign of distress.  </p>
							<p>Now, as your looking down upon the tea gathering in the gardens from the tower. You see the SCP come hastily in, with a grim look on his face, and making a beeline for the OS. And they have quick conversation, and they both start heading towards your tower. So you check comms, and see the "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message. As well as the "connection lost" message. How would that make you feel?</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Vindictive that you were right all along.
								<li>Panicking. Cause where the fuck is your partner.
								<li>Angry. Where the fuck is my partner. I'm going to burn down a small unnecessary building.
								<li>Let's go the logic route. We're finding this fucker and I'm smacking the shit out of him.
