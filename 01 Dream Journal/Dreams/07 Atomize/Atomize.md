								<p>The story begins in a village at the edge of a vast empire composed of thousands of medium to small islands, each with unique magical abilities.</p>
								<p>We find ourselves in the body of a young man, <b>Xenos</b>, who, despite his unassuming exterior, harbors a significant secret. He, and his twin sister, <b>Levana</b>, are the last two remaining <i>Oracles</i> in the isles. While he labors as the Captain of the Guards, his sister remains bedridden due to her visions ruining her body.</p>
								<p><b>Xenos</b> have been sent to the village of <i>Maoria</i> to find credible evidence against the corrupt mayor colluding with <b>the crown prince</b>. We enter <b>Xeno’s</b> body as he ends a remote meeting between <b>Amore</b>, the second prince, and <b>Ithe</b>, the royal mage. <b>Amore</b> had left for his duties earlier, but <b>Xenos</b> and <b>Ithe</b> were still speaking—more accurately, having a relationship spat.</p>
								<p>While <b>Ithe’s</b> powers of intuition aren’t as strong or as accurate as <b>Levana’s</b> or <b>Xenos</b>, his instincts are next to none. His gut has been churning since sunset, and he's afraid of his partner being on the other side of the kingdom alone in a place he cannot get to. <b>Xenos</b> is too stubborn to listen to <b>Ithe's</b> pleads for him to leave, and it has caused a massive argument.</p>
								<p>Of course, <b>Ithe</b>, as usual, right. Minutes after ending communication, the village is attacked by a mysterious demon army with an unending hoard of hellhounds. <b>Xenos</b> barely manages to escape with his life, sending out a distress call right before he shut down communications in order not to be magiaclly traced.</p>

								<p>So now we're on the run on foot. Any other form of transportation was either killed or destroyed. Fun fact about hellhounds, they have 4 legs and are very fast. We may be very fast, but we only have two legs. So the chase is long and harrowing. Not long after the beginning, we realize there something else with four legs following us. But it doesn't have the same demonic energy as the other beasts following us. And while we lose the hellhounds somehow, this animal is still making a beeline for us.</p>
								<p>While we're hurriedly trying to make a boat. A headless dog bursts into the clearing. And we discover what the real purpose of that town was. The CP was attempting to create an army of unkillable creatures. And started experiments with small rodents. And had worked his way up to dogs. This pupper was the only success. Sensing no ill will coming from it, we allow it to climb up in our backpack, and we make haste across the water.</p>
								<p>We arrive back in the capital, through not exactly legal means. Concerned about the headless nature of our new dog, we craft him a head, and with a little magic and a blue handkerchief, we have a totally completely normal Pyrenees dog.</p>
								<p>On the way back up to the castle through the catacombs, we are stopped by the CP's men. Who attempt to arrest us under the pretense of us being the cause of the destruction of the village. And also tried to take our dog. Which is honestly bullshit and everyone there knew it. Lucky for us, we were then teleported into the RM's chamber, where the aforementioned mage, the TWO CP's and our sister were waiting.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="box">
								<div class="callout-title"> <div class="callout-title-inner">  Kill Yourself, Come On Do Us All a Favour  </div> </div>
								<p> The CP was there, cause he had known that I had been sent to investigate the village. And was also concerned when the village was destroyed. He himself knew that it wasn't me. So barged into our going to be reunion with discussions of politics. He's kind of a dick. </p>
								<p> It turns out, at the start of the empire, the original oracle predicted the destruction of the kingdom as we know it to be done by demons. And it'll start with the dogs. Which was very concerning, so it became a royal secret passed down through first crown princes. Imagine how upset everyone else in the room was when they found this out. A lot of arguing happened and nothing got done. </p>
								<p> But more importantly, or loyal doggo betrayed us. He instantly took a liking to our sister. And she was as equally taken by him. She didn't even care that he was headless! So the bitch dog laid there getting belly rubs. We want belly rubs and head scritches too!   </p>
								<p> A few days past, and one day we wake up with the largest bout of brain fog and nausea we've ever experienced. And we only knew one thing. "I got to get the docks".  So our clearly horrendously sick self managed to get down through the city to the docks. And upon arrival, we have the most powerful vision we've ever received. So powerful the vision gets shared between our sister, so to not kill us. We see the destruction and burning of the capital. And we see that the demon ships are but barely over the horizon. We have less than half a day. </p>
								<p> While our sister is up at the castle, working through her half of the sickness, while informing everyone, we start our way back up to the castle. However, half way, our mind clears a little, and we make a decision. We’re staying. And only us.   </p>
								<p> We manage to flag down two soldiers that can read and write, and send up a letter to our loved ones. And we return the docks, sword and armor on hand. And we wait. </p>

							<p>Hello everyone, you might have noticed that I'm not in the castle. Today, as I'm sure you've heard from REDACTED that we've both received the prophecy of the destruction of the kingdom. But more importantly, I guess I should explain how I got down here. I woke up with the most devastating headache I've ever had. Now that I think about it, it was probably a migraine. I digress. All I knew was that I had to get down to the docks. Now I might have scared some of our citizens with the sluggish way I was walking. But it's a bit too late now. We have more pressing matters at hand. Which I'll get to in a minute.</p>
							<p>When I arrived at the docks, as soon as I set foot on wood planks it's made of, my mind was flung forward. And an influx of information greeted my third eye. The demons are just across the horizon. And their army has grown. Those killed by them are taking up as thralls. There are more hellhounds than ever before. This is not a battle that can be won. I strongly recommend we evacuate everyone, citizens and soldiers alike.</p>
							<p>This may come as a surprise to you, but I've decided to stay. My mind is clearing as these two excellent young fellows are writing. And it's my duty to protect this kingdom to my dying breath. Ergo, I'm staying and you can't convince me otherwise. So I am to write down my last words to you.</p>
							<p><b>REDACTED</b>: You have been one of my closest friends since childhood. And since then, I knew that you would make a much better king than that bitch of a brother. Growing up alongside of you was one of the happiest experiences in my life. From beating you in horse races, to beating to you in hunting competitions to beating you in finding love first, I have loved one upping you in every aspect in life. I jest. You're the closest thing to an older brother I have ever had. And for that I love and adore you. Please do not miss me when I'm gone. I'm going to haunt your ass, so we can continue pilfering the kitchens for the rest of our lives.</p>
							<p><b>REDACTED</b>: My beloved baby sister. I'm sorry for all of the pain I have caused you over the years. Physically and mentally. It seems to the very end I was unable to cure you of that damn curse. And for that, I will apologize for the rest of eternity. I know that I haven't said it enough growing up but I love you. Since the death of our parents, it's been you and me against the world, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Please forget anything mean I said during puberty, I didn't mean any of it. I was lashing out at the wrong person. It's something I'll never forgive myself for. As you continue on to be the last oracle living, I hope the rest of your prophecies be merry.</p>
							<p><b>REDACTED</b>: Hey love. I know you're probably mad at me. And you should be. Making this decision without your input. But I feel like it was important to do. I'm sorry that our last few conversations have been arguments due to my own pig headed behavior.  I'm sorry that I'm throwing a massive wrench in our plans for the future. You didn't ask for such an idiot of a boyfriend did you. I love you too the moons and back, and then some. May I forever last in your memory, as I speak your name as my final breath.</p>

							<p>Imagine you're the RM. And the last conversation you had with your partner was telling him he needs to leave a dangerous situation and he ignored you. And you ended the communications on a sour note. And you're trying to go about your duties, keeping your mind off of worrying about him. Cause, you’re the great Royal Mage! You can't show sign of distress.  </p>
							<p>Now, as your looking down upon the tea gathering in the gardens from the tower. You see the SCP come hastily in, with a grim look on his face, and making a beeline for the OS. And they have quick conversation, and they both start heading towards your tower. So you check comms, and see the "HOLY FUCK SHIT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG" message. As well as the "connection lost" message. How would that make you feel?</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Vindictive that you were right all along.
								<li>Panicking. Cause where the fuck is your partner.
								<li>Angry. Where the fuck is my partner. I'm going to burn down a small unnecessary building.
								<li>Let's go the logic route. We're finding this fucker and I'm smacking the shit out of him.
