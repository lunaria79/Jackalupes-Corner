							<p>Two girls are suddenly captured by a portal, and are transported to a tropical island full of strange Pokémon. As they walk through the forest, unafraid, many Pokémon approached them in curiosity. Eventually, a Pokémon that look similar to a bear cub stained yellow, approached them with a gleam of higher intelligence in his eye. It leads them to a group of <b>5 Guys</b>, who in turn lead them to the scientist that is the defacto leader of the island. <b>The scientist</b>, being there the longest (since the 1600s), has gone crazy, but is loving it. Spends most of her days talking to her plants and doing experiments. However, <b>Gaia</b> doesn't see her fit to be a leader, and tries to take charge. <b>Janet</b> stands awkwardly behind everyone.</p>

							<p>Fed up with her attitude, <b>Janet</b> rightfully points out <b>Gaia's</b> selfishness, which causes the young women to detonate. How dare <b>Janet</b> speak to her in that way? As she erupts in anger, <b>Gaia</b> attacks <b>Janet</b>, trying to steal her bears.</p>

							<p>While <b>Gaia</b> and <b>the scientist</b> were talking, <b>Sun</b> lead <b>Janet</b> to a crystal hatch that had mysteriously opened. Upon leading her to <b>Moon</b>, the two cubs initiated a soul contract with <b>Janet</b>, and they were so cute she had to accept.  After the contract is finished, she exits the hatch and immediately runs in to <b>the scientist</b>. <b>The scientist</b> explains how never could figure out how to open the hatch, and gave up trying when starting to focus on survival. When arriving back at <b>the scientists</b> home, Gaia is consumed by jealousy, as she had been wanting to keep <b>Sun</b> as a pet. She was trying to convince one of the <b>Five Guys</b> to give her one of their few pokéballs. As <b>Gaia</b> watches the three interact, she grows angrier and angrier, and plants start to grow out of her body, beautiful and deadly.</p>

							<p><b>Gaia</b> is quite a popular girl, whose used to getting her way. Her and <b>Janet</b> are good friends, however, having known each other since the cradle days. When the island starts affecting their minds, she becomes consumed by her anger at not being the special one for once.</p>

							<p>Janet is significantly less popular than <b>Gaia</b>, and kept to her self. She loves <b>Gaia</b>, but entering school has seriously changed her from the kind and loving child she once knew. The island didn't affect her mind like <b>Gaia</b> and <b>the scientist</b>,  as it had chosen her as it's <b>deity [subject to change] </b>.</p>

						<div class="box char-note">
							<div class="callout-title">  <div class="callout-title-inner"> Sun & Moon </div> </div>
							<p><b>Sun</b> and <b>Moon</b> are the twin familiars that are chosen for Janet. <b>Sun</b> is a very excitable and demanding cub, always wanting to be held. <b>Moon</b> spends most of her days sleeping, but when more awake is very sweet and cuddly.</p>

							<div class="callout-title">  <div class="callout-title-inner"> The Scientist </div> </div>
							<p>All that is known about <b>The Scientist</b> is that she was transported to the island during a car crash after she and her team broke their team lead out of jail. She does not know what happened to the others.</p>
