			<h1>The Secret Garden</h1>
			<h2> Aurora Aksnes </h2>
			<p> 
				<span> Where have you been hiding? </span>
				<br> <span> You seem lost within your body and your mind </span>
				<br> <span> A beam of light can still remind you who you are </span>
				<br> <span> Wounded by the world </span>
				<br> <span> Your fragile nature needed shelter </span>
				<br> <span> In the night we made a sanctum </span>
				<br> <span> Out of mind and out of sight </span>
				<br> <span> Won't you let me take you there? </span>
				<br> <span> Won't you let me take you there? </span>
				<br> <span> Let me take you into the garden, into the garden </span>
				<br> <span> I'll be there, painting the flowers, give them color </span>
				<br> <span> I'll be there </span>
				<br> <span> Listen to the anthem </span>
				<br> <span> Hear the flowers like their hymn has healing power </span>
				<br> <span> Take my hand and breathe in the colorful </span>
				<br> <span> Won't you let me take you there? </span>
				<br> <span> Won't you let me take you there? </span>
				<br> <span> Let me take you into the garden, into the garden </span>
				<br> <span> I'll be there, painting the flowers, give them color </span>
				<br> <span> I'll be there </span>
				<br> <span> Let me take you into the garden, into the garden </span>
				<br> <span> I'll be there, painting the flowers, give them color </span>
				<br> <span> I'll be there </span>
				<br> <span> Try to heal the heart of mind </span>
				<br> <span> In the garden we find </span>
				<br> <span> Try to heal the heart of mind </span>
				<br> <span> In the garden we find </span>
				<br> <span> Inside, inside </span>
