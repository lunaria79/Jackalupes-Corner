>>> [!multi-column]

>>>> [!story-arc]+ story arc
>>>> The group is getting ready to go to a fancy dinner and an interview with a huge asshole interviewer. The two sisters are working through their anxiety about it, and the men, while also anxious, are pretending everything is fine and rough housing. The manager has had the MC and the LI in a fake PR relationship, which at this point has every member going, "yeah... PR relationship....". It's not official yet or anything lmao.
>>>> While waiting for the limo, the MC starts to get flashbacks, but wants to continue because she doesn't want to let the group down. (They would not have given a single shit, go take a sick day love we support you) So of course, she doesn't tell anyone, but both the LI and OS notice something is off. They both try to cheer her up by horsing around a little (Love Interest) and discussing the flora in the area (Older Sister). It works, and she returns to the present. For now.
>>>> In the limo, the interviewer starts asking her probing rude questions about her past, causing her to start having more flashbacks. The rest of the group intervenes, and the interviewer is kicked out at a stop light.
>>>> During the dinner, the MC spends most of it crying and having flashbacks in the private bathroom. Poor MC.

>>>> [!story-arc]+ Random Scene
>>>> **Love Interest:** (half jokingly) Did you get lost and the hotel manager touch you?  
>>>> **Main Character:** (half paying attention) Not this time.  
>>>> **Love Interest:** (extremely seriously) What do you mean this time?  
>>>> **Main Character:** Oh look I think our limo is here.  
>>>> **Love Interest:** Wait--  
>>>> (AS A WAY TO DEAL WITH HER TRUAMA, SHE LIKES TO JOKE ABOUT IT WITH HER SISTER AND BANDMATES. SHE IS FINE WITH THE JOKE, AND IF SHE WAS PAYING ATTENTION SHE PROBABLY WOULDVE LAUGHED)

>>>> [!story-arc]+ Random Scene
>>>> As they arrive at the red carpet and step out, MC feels like her stomach is collapsing in on herself. On a regular day, she would've paid them no mind, but the camera flashes flings her mind back to her past. She feels like she's going to barf. Instinctively, she curls into the LI's side, and his arm raps around her protectively. He leans down and whispers in her ear, asking if she needs to leave. Her back straightens, her mind clears, and she assures him that she can handle this. It's only a matter of time until she crumbles again.

>>> [!multi-column]
>>>
>>>> [!char-note]+ younger sister
>>>> The main character. Always wearing big puffy blue dresses. Of African descent, ambiagious from where. Tall, but not as tall as the love interest or her sister. Suffers a lot do traumatic upbring filled with abuse and assault.
>>>
>>>> [!char-note]+ older sister
>>>> The older of the two women. Commonly wears black and/or green mermaid style dresses. Most likely Hispanic mixed with Eastern European. Serious, but quite caring. Loves her little sister dearly, but is struggling to help her with her mental health issues. Probably has some kind of autism. Likes fancy deserts.

>>> [!multi-column]
>>>
>>>> [!char-note]+ lover boy
>>>> The youngest of the three men. He and the MC have a lot of playful banter. Loves suits with yellow accents. Mixed race, don't know of what. Brown hair, tan skin, green eyes. On the taller side.
>>>
>>>> [!char-note]+ other bandmates
>>>> A bit older than the rest of the group. Kind and understanding. A bit goofy? Gay dads.

>>> [!multi-column]
>>>
>>>> [!note]+ note
>>>> A 5 member A Capella group. Very famous. 3 men, 2 women. I believe that is a modern setting? But the cars and dresses did not match. Like, antebellum dresses, but 1980s cars?  
>>>> Strangers to Lovers. Much angst due to trauma 
>>>> At the end of the dream, there were some fantasy elements that i might abandon. I.E. the MC is a vampire that was forcefully turned *twice*.  
>>>> Possibly A/B/O??? I don't really remember all of the specifics, but I def remember a scene where the two sisters were scenting each other in the car. The older sisters hair was long and soft, a little curly. All three men are very protective, could tie in to pack dynamics?  
>>>> The Main Character and Love Interest, while not together yet, are quite touchy. I remember the Love Interests hands were quite big when they wrapped around the MC's waist when picking her up.  
>>>> The MC was wearing 9 inch heels and *struggling*, but i think that that was because i was inhabiting a portion of her brain, and will remove that from the story
