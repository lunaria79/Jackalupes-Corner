			</div>
			<p class="reporter">Hello students. We here at SOTA border Tàiyáng De Yáolán, or in common, The Sun's Cradle. This empire reaches from the skies to the depths of the Middle Sea, but remains hidden to the surrounding world. Join us today as we speak to the empire's 4th prince, Liu Fènghuáng. Yuàn tài yáng shēng qǐ Fènghuáng, how are you today?</p>
			<p>  Yuàn yuè liàng luò shān, I am doing well. </p>
			<p class="reporter"> As a fellow student with Common as a second language, I admire your refusal to speak to those who do not try to pronounce your name correctly. </p>
			<p>My name is a huge sense of pride to me now, I will not accept anything less.  <i>*pauses a moment* </i>Forgive me, I lie... <i>*sighs*</i> My lovely guildmates have started calling me Peppe to bully me.</p>
			<p class="reporter"> To bully you?</p>
			<p> My nose is sensitive to pepper. While I do cook with it, I contain it carefully to prevent distress. Those with pets or small children understand you cannot prepare for every eventuality. In my haste to fumigate the room, there is a small chance I possibly mispronounced a few words. And a good friend will never let that go.</p>
			<p class="reporter"> I noticed that you used the word "now" to describe how you feel about your name. If you do not mind, could you expound on that?</p>
			<p>Many are cruel to those considered others. I have since realized to ignore their condemnations. There is no shame in the femineity of my name, and I embrace it wholeheartedly.</p>
			<p class="reporter"> [Insert sentence of support here] Can you provide a pronunciation guide for your name? </p>
			<p>Leo Fung-HooAhng. Spoken from the back of your throat.</p>

				<p>Xiao Fèng is the name his adoptive siblings call him.</p>
				<p>Phoenixes only have one child. And they die in childbirth. And up until Fènghuáng's birth, every descendant of the original phoenix is a woman. And it is tradition to name the child Liu Fènghuàng. When Fènghuáng was born, his adopted mother still wanted to continue the tradition. It didn't lead to an easy early childhood, but he's grown to love his name. </p>
				<p>Nor calls him "love" when he's trying to tease him. Only in private though. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="box char-note">
			<p class="reporter">You have talked in the past about your struggles with self-worth and projecting insecurity on others. Could you possibly give any advice to our readers who also struggle with these issues?</p>
			<p>  The way I was raised caused me to be quite isolated from the world around me. The only support I garnered was from my adoptive mother and her children, and even that was limited do to the constant power struggles the Emperor and my fellow princes' engaged in. I struggled with my lot in life, which often drove me to some very dark places. As well as being confused by who I was as a person outside of my prince status, I lashed out at others for that was the only way how I knew to be heard.</p>
			<p>I am not afraid to admit how absolutely terrible I was behaving when I arrived here. And I am incredibly ashamed. Although there are numerous explanations for my behavior, it was uncouth of me to act the way that I did. I do extend my humble apologies to all that I had negatively impacted during that time.</p>

				<p>He has panic attacks ever-so-often about living up to his ancestor's reputations. </p>
				<p>In the beginning, Fènghuáng was scared of and uncertain of his own sexual identity. After meeting Aefir, though, those problems solve themselves very quickly.</p>

			<p class="reporter">If you could speak your mind freely to the Empress, what would you say?</p>
			<p>  Thank you for cherishing me, even in the face of great opposition. Without you and your daughter's love, I would not be sitting here today. I am eternally greatful to you. </p>

			<p class="reporter">What do you find yourself doing in your free time?</p>
			<p> I've found that I find cleaning very relaxing. And I'm the chef of the household, seeing that Book is a cat and Aefir is helpless. Aefir is banned from my kitchen. In my pocket dimension, there's a perfect recreation of the Emperoress's Floating Gardens. I tend to flora and fauna there, while Book is napping. When alone at home, I tend to wander aimlessly through the rooms until someone comes home. Aefir and Book are so loud together, it's strange when it's quite.</p>

				<p> He walks in such a way that it appears like he's floating.</p>
				<p> Fènghuáng learned how to take care of Texture 4 hair because he was sick of tired of Book's rats nest of a head. Though it cannot say so, it's appreciative of his efforts. </p>

			<p>Fènghuáng stands at 6'3, which is abnormal for the people of Tàiyáng Dìguó. He's deathly pale, with a small nose, thin lips, and small sharp pink eyes. He has mysterious white markings on his forehead and cheeks. His pinkish red hair is usually tied back in a ponytail.  Fènghuáng is very proud of his culture and heritage, so he can be seen around campus wearing the school uniform with a matching traditional shan on top.</p>

			<p>Large white wings tipped with fire emerged from his back and smaller pink wings replace his ears. Red feathers grow on his shoulders and shoulder blades. He dons a white hanfu, accented with reds, oranges, and golds.</p>
