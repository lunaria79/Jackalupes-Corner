							</div>
							<p> <b>Adelaide</b> starts making friends in her classroom, when she was forced into a group project. <b>Cole</b> and the others seemed a bit uppity, but weren't rude so she liked them. She won them over with her hard work and treats she brought from home. </p>
							<p> But for some fucking reason, her classmate <b> Alex </b> inserts himself in the group, demands she give him some of the noodles she had made, and when she didn't have any desert left to give him, broke into her backpack and stole some of her strawberry ice cream. She grabs him by the shirt, almost punches the daylights out of him, takes a deep breath, and then asks calmly (for her) why the hell he was behaving this way. </p>
							<p> Presumably because he thought she had gone soft, Alex proceeds to attack the surrounding disciplinary students that were trying to intervene. Seeing <b> Alex </b> attack her new friends, <b> Adelaide </b> sees red and body slams him through a table. At this point the bell rings and <b> Alex </b> escapes into the fray. </p>

							</div>
							<p> <b> Adelaide</b> was reassigned to a new bus (Bus #69) which turns out to be the same bus where all the pathetic misplaced nerds go. While never meeting her, all of the nerds are terrified of her due to her reputation. An honestly really cute black girl named <b> Janet</b> was elected to try and stop her when she got on, but <b> Adelaide</b> says "It's kind of you to try and hug me, but we don't know each other well enough for that. " (Our <b> Adelaide</b> is kind of dumb.) </p>
							<p><b> Adelaide </b> selects her seat towards the middle of the bus, which is later taken up by a strange tall blonde man, with a gleam in his eye. Reveals himself as <b> Matteo </b>, and starts asking strange questions, like "What do you like to do outside of school?" and "What do you think about these outfit ideas?". His friend named <b>Judas</b> regularly chimes in with a joke or anecdote. <b> Adelaide </b> is not entirely sure what's happening, but it feels nice so she lets it continue.</p>

							<p> FAKE ASS BITCH. I HATE YOU. Turns out, he was pulling the strings behind the scenes for ruining Adelaide's reputation. You see, if everyone else is focused on the big bad, who would pay attention to him slowly taking up power? Remember <b> Alex</b>? <b>Judas</b> blackmailed him to do all that shit. Has been feeding <b>Cole</b> and <i>the Canaries</i> false information to throw them off the track. <b>Matteo</b> however, caught him in a lie, revealing him to be the <i>only</i> person who could've swapped out <b>Adelaide's</b> meds for sugar pills.

							<p> You remember that guy you saw at Sheetz? Multiply his twink by four. 6'8, incredibly wiry. Long blond hair, extremely pretty. Awkward as hell. Fashion autism but scared of being called gay. Not because he's homophobic, but the school is. Was terrified of Adelaide for 5 seconds and then, upon seeing model potential, instantly fell in love with her. He's _down bad_ down bad. It's pathetic really. All he wants is muscle mommy with big hands. Regularly fantasizes about her edging him. What a freak. </p>

							<p>><b>Cole</b> is the leader of <i>the Canaries</i>, the disciplinary club of the school. When one of his teachers assigned <b>Adelaide</b> to a group project with him and his friends, he took up the opportunity as a chance to "re-educate" her.

He and his friends, while not publicly being friends with her, decide to launch a private investigation behind the scenes on why the school treated her so badly.</p>

						<p>I know that I write <b>Adelaide</b> as the dumbest person in the room, but she's actually quite smart. Just not socially aware at all. Book smarts? Out the wazoo. Street smarts? Who needs smarts when you have a mean grimace and two fists? Interpersonal relationships? She was never taught how to navigate those, but is trying her best. I think that she was in whatever system that has funneled her in to this school from birth. Like, preemptively had some issues as a child and never got the correct treatment. A few kind souls here and there, but they were also fooled by the system. Could this be a convoluted attempt at a critique of capitalism? My story always end up that way.</p>

						<p> I'm think that even though <b>Judas</b> is a major villain, he is <i>still</i>a victim to the society that has forced him into believe that this behavior is the only way to survive. The actual big bad is the dystopian society the school has fostered.</p>
						<p><b>Judas</b> isn't in love with <b>Matteo</b>, he's in love with control. He may be infatuated with <b>Matteo</b>, but he doesn't love him. Any point that he claims otherwise is pure manipulation, as well as self-convincing. Of course, <b>Judas</b> isn't doing anything wrong, this is to protect us <b>Matteo</b>. </p>
